Memories of going to the cinema when I was little. Valley of the Gwangi. Monster movies on TV - usually while visiting my Nan's house. Godzilla movies while my Mum cleaned Nan's. Memories of Star Wars, and latterly taking my own children to the cinema. The magic. Also petty hates, such as food, and talking.
