            <Synopsis>Working with Leeanne from my flat
</Synopsis>
            <Text>While sitting in the office one Friday afternoon in early 2000, a rumour flew around the staff that the company was in trouble. Nobody could confirm anything, which of course made everything worse. I remember going home that weekend, and wondering what I would do if the company failed - I had a mortgage - I had bought my own flat only a few months previously.

Over the course of the weekend I had an idea. If the company was about to go under, why not jump before I went down with it, and go freelance? It might actually be a win-win, because the company could hire me back as a contractor if they wanted to, but not have me on the books. In the meantime, I could have a proper crack at doing web development for some design agencies.

I talked to the girl I worked with on the phone, and she thought it was a great idea. She also wanted in - she wanted to jump ship with me. I spent the Saturday night researching the legal side of partnerships, and emailing friends to see who might lend us the money.

With money behind us, and a partnership agreement signed, we returned to work on the Monday morning, and handed our notice in. The managing director was furious, and asked me to leave the building immediately. While walking back to my apartment, half-way across town, my mobile phone rang. It was my boss.

“I’ve calmed down a bit now.”

Over the next few minutes, we discussed how we might work together going forwards, and how this might actually benefit both of us. It was all a bit surreal really.

Of course nothing ever happens the way you might like. A few weeks later no money had appeared in the bank, and I ended up going to visit the citizens advice bureau - a free legal advice facility run by most local authorities. Apparently this was a really, really bad thing to do, because it turned the screw on the relationship between myself and my ex-boss, and pretty much guaranteed that we would get no work from them going forwards.

We had fifteen thousand in the bank, and were starting from zero. What could possibly go wrong?

It turns out pretty much everything. Back in 2000, the web design business hadn’t really caught fire yet - so we found ourselves visiting design houses and printing companies, trying to convince them that the internet was coming, and they really needed to use us. It didn’t work at all.

One glimmer of hope appeared in the shape of a printing company a few hundred yards from where we had worked previously. They could see the potential of getting involved in web design, and had all the design talent already - but more importantly they needed a database to be built to run their business on. They talked a lot, and never actually went ahead with anything.

We built a software solution for a university graduate setting up a translation business, and wrote some forms for a healthcare project - through a local printing company that had no web skills - but other than that, it was very slim pickings.

We survived for about four months - through the autumn and winter of 2000, into 2001, before calling it a day. Of course at the same time I had met a girl - Wendy - and was becoming increasingly distracted by spending time with her. We had got engaged in the late autumn, and were talking about moving in together. Given my situation, it made more sense to look for a job near her, than to move anywhere else.

There’s a story about the engagement ring actually. Wendy had come over to visit me for the weekend - we had been engaged for a week - and we went out to look at rings. Our “real” engagement ring was a hematite ring bought while walking in the Lake District - 99p from a gift shop. The real thing cost several hundred pounds, and unbeknown to Wendy put my bank account into overdraft for a few days. Thankfully I managed to get hold of the bank while walking away from the jewellers, and warned them in advance.

After deciding to stop the whole freelance/partnership thing, I stayed for a long weekend at Wendy’s house, wrote= my CV, and applied to some job agencies. By the Monday evening I had two interviews lined up - one for the Tuesday morning just outside the town she lived, and another for later in the week at a huge Japanese company.

The interview the next morning is told elsewhere. Suffice to say I’m still working there now, so it must have gone quite well. I remember calling the agent back to cancel the second interview though (because I had already accepted the first job), and them going ever so slightly mad. Of course I knew why - they were obviously going to get a fee for delivering an interview candidate, no matter what happened. I had essentially cost the agency money.</Text>

            <Title>First Computer</Title>
            <Text>The first time I ever saw a computer was in the spare room at my grandparents house. It looked like something from a 1970s science fiction movie, and was threatening to destroy the table it was precariously perched upon - such was it's girth. It had been purchased to use for book-keeping at the family business, and was being prepared with accounts software. Of course I didn't know this at the time - I was only seven or eight years old - all I knew was that it looked awesome, and that I was not allowed to go near it, breathe on it, or touch it under any circumstances.

The computer re-appeared some years later - perched on top of a chest of drawers in my brother's bedroom during the school summer holidays. Dad returned home from work with it one day, wired it up, and let us play with it. We had no idea what the computer might be able to do, how to use it, or what it might even be useful for. We played with it in the same manner I had played with the old cooker in the garage - pretending we were commanders on a space rocket - pressing buttons, shouting random commands, and spending hours on flights of imagination around the universe.

Luckily my brother had a friend. During the early 1980s most people had a similar friend. He knew about computers. He also had a comically bad haircut, and didn't go outside much - but that was all forgotten when he sat down in front of the computer in my brother's bedroom, slid a floppy disk into the slot in the front of the machine, turned the lever that locked the strange floppy rectangle in- place, and began typing.

After several minutes watching him type - munching on chocolate biscuits and drinking orange squash - we were invited to sit in front of the computer.

"What planet would you like to destroy ?"

> |

The cursor sat, blinking - waiting for us to type something in.

> Earth

"Earth will be destroyed in..."
"5..."
"4..."
"3..."
"2..."
"1..."
"Earth has been destroyed."

We stared at the screen with eyes like saucers. We had just destroyed the earth. It was both scary, and exciting at the same time. Not only could we now go on imaginary flights around the solar system - we could blow up planets, and the computer said it had really happened. Over the course of the next few minutes we blew up every planet in the local solar system, the school, next door's dog, the ice cream van we could hear several streets away, and any number of other things that came to mind. As each detonation was announced, a chorus of "it's my turn!" would ring out across the bedroom.

Not knowing how to save the program my brother's friend had written, we printed it out. Every time we wanted to play the game again, we would re-key the program. Occasionally we tried to change the programming to make it more impressive, but that invariably led to the computer silently murmuring "Syntax Error" at us.

Oh the fun we had that summer. We didn't need an X-Box, or a Playstation, or girls - we were too busy blowing up planets. Strangely it never occurred to us that blowing up the planet you were standing on was a ridiculous thing to do.

Then one day a disaster happened. The computer stopped working. It made odd clunking noises after turning it on, and the screen reported some jibbering or other about not finding something or other. We did what any normal person would do - we cleaned the computer. After fetching a can of furniture polish, and a duster, we cleaned it to within an inch of it's life - including the floppy disks. Looking back, we probably made it much, much worse. It was now very clean, smelled of a meadow in springtime, and didn't work at all.

It's funny how childhood works though, because a few minutes after the disaster unfolded there was a knock at the door, and we all went out to play. The computer was eventually donated to the local secondary school - to be used as a "skeleton" for educational purposes. The computer teacher also mentioned that it would make the classroom look quite cool.</Text>

            <Title>Electric Organs</Title>
            <Text>During the late 1980s, my parents became interested in music keyboards. How they became interested in them is perhaps one of the most unlikely stories you're likely to hear.

You see - throughout the late 1980s my brother competed in schoolboy motocross. This mostly entailed getting up early on a Sunday morning, and standing in the rain throughout the day, watching him ride round a muddy track in circles until we went home again. There was of course more to it than that, but to my twelve year old eyes, that was about the size of it.

My parents made friends with numerous other parents, who also stood in the rain each Sunday watching their children ride round and round in circles - or in the case of one particularly memorable Dad, run after his son for several miles every Sunday, repeatedly putting him back on the bike. My Mum and one friend in particular took to sitting in the car and talking for seven or eight hours every Sunday. I have no idea what they talked about. They are still friends now - thirty years on - and still talk on the phone for hours. What DO women talk about on the phone?

Over the time the friendship between our families grew, and we invited each other for dinner - and that's how we ended up sitting in their back room one Saturday night, messing around on their electric organ (which sounds perverted, thinking about it). Let's call it a multi-keyboard-musical-instrument instead.

I'm not quite sure how the story played out, but our friends bought a new music keyboard - the latest thing that Yamaha made at the time - meaning the old one in their back room was available for anybody with a suitable trailer - cough, a motocross bike trailer - to take away. And that's how it ended up in our back room instead.

Have you ever seen an electric organ? (stop laughing). It was mostly made from wood, had two keyboards, and a row of buttons to simulate different instruments across the facia above. The rather odd thing about the switches was that they didn't really have much effect - a Cello, Violin, Piano, Electric Guitar, and Xylophone all sounded pretty much like they came from the soundtrack of a 1970s porn film - especially so when you switched on the drum machine, which was liable to get pensioners for miles out of their seats, such was it's astounding recreation of anything Glen Miller might have written.

Unfortunately we knew nothing about playing music, or musical instruments - so quite often we ended up sounding like Glen Miller during his plane crash, instead of with a full orchestra in front of an appreciative audience. That didn't stop us though - because it turns out you don't really need talent if you have enough technology available.

Within months the hulking electric organ had been moved to my grandparents house, from where it would eventually become firewood, to be replaced by the same model of keyboard our friends had bought. As a family we attended a number of pre-sales events run by the local music superstore, and saw immensely talented people take to the stage that made the keyboards sound amazing. Unfortunately we were still somewhat lacking in the talent department, but we made up for it with enthusiasm, and blind optimism.

Oh the hours I spent waiting for my parents in music shops. Perhaps the most memorable was Duckson and Pinker in Swindon. Downstairs was a typical music shop full of instruments - upstairs was an Aladdin's cave of sheet music, and classical music albums. As far as I can recall, there were two members of staff upstairs - an elderly man who always dressed very smartly, and a tooth lady with long straight hair and very thick glasses. I never spoke to either of them. The elderly man seemed to be in charge of shelves full of audiophile Hi-Fi separates - amplifiers, pre-amplifiers, record decks, and so on. There were always huge posters of the classical music stars of the day in clip-frames on the walls - Julian Lloyd Webber sticks in my memory for some reason - along with Herbert von Karajan.

The music keyboard demonstrations typically took place in hired out community centres and dance halls in nearby towns. It was quite an event - going out for the evening on the premise of enjoying a performance by a professional musician, when in reality you were being lined up for a sales and marketing hit.

I remember one demonstration in particular. One of the team from Japan had been flown over by Yamaha to demonstrate a new keyboard. His name was Max Takano - he was young, incredibly talented, and he neither understood, or spoke a word of English. We took my elderly grandfather with us for the night out, and sat in wonder at the skill and spectacle of it all. Then, while leaving the auditorium at the end, my Grandfather - who had fought in the Eighth Army during the second world war, stood up, straightened his coat, and asked very loudly among the sea of people "What did you reckon to that Nip then?"

Over the course of several years we kept several music shops afloat. We progressed from smaller Yamaha music keyboards, to ever more impressive ones. The final, and most ridiculous was called the HX-1. If you've never seen one, all you have to do is watch the movie "The Running Man" - early in the movie they keyboard appears in a projection of what the world might be like a few decades into the future. To be honest, it WAS impressive. It looked like the result of an illicit affair between the Space Shuttle, and a Japanese sports car - festooned with lights, buttons, and angular slabs of grey plastic. It also sounded incredible. There was only one problem - we did not.

You remember I mentioned about technology perhaps filling the shortfall between hopes and reality though? Dad came home from work one Friday night with a pile of magazines in his hands. He had been reading them at work, and had an idea.

"Do you want to come to Evesham with me tomorrow?"

"Why?"

"I'm going to buy a new computer - to plug into the music keyboard."

He handed me a magazine, which had a computer called an "Atari ST" on the cover.</Text>

            <Title>4 Burswin Road</Title>
            <Synopsis>Growing up at Burswin Road, and Davis Close. Memories of the house, the neighbours, toys, my parents, their friends, and so on.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Until I was 5 years old, we lived in a small bungalow near the corner of a quiet road, in a sleepy town in the middle of the Cotswolds called Carterton. Until I was 5 years old I really had no idea about the wider world, because the limits of my existence were pretty much the front gate of the house, and the seemingly vast expanse of the back garden.

The house on our left was owned by a pretty lady called Jackie, who sunbathed in the garden wearing paisley bikinis (I was only five, but I knew I wanted her to like me). The only time I can really remember visiting her house was to wash her car in return for a milkshake. Being only five years old, I can only imagine the mess we made of her car, and we probably got more soapy water on ourselves than the car, but that memory has stuck with me for nearly forty years now.

On the other side of the house lived a boy called Stephen that was older than me. I would walk to the wall separating our houses and have conversations with him about our dog, Sheena. He seemed tremendously grown up and knowledgeable about the world. He was probably eight or nine years old. Sheena was a rough collie (Lassie, for anybody that remembers her - although if you’re as Nerdy as me, you also know that Lassie was played by male dogs - one of which was called Bruce), owned by my Dad before he met my Mum. My Grandparents also had a King Charles spaniel that seemingly bit anybody and everything in sight - I’ll return to her later.

The front garden of our house was surrounded by an impossibly high (2ft) red brick wall with castellations. The drive that stretched along the side of the house was met by an wrought iron gate, that my brother once got his head stuck in the bars of. Apparently a very strong man from across the road called Alistair had to bend the gate to release him.

Both the front and back gardens were covered in grass - and the back garden had a step in it, with a small wall stretching across the width of the garden to separate the levels. In the far left corner of the back garden was a tree that my cousin Brian once fell out of. I remember the panic in his voice and the snapping sound the branches made as he slid down the trunk, before trying to dust himself off and not burst into tears once back on his feet.

Beyond the end of the garden was a sudden drop - the height of an adult. I don’t really recall what stopped us falling over the edge - blind fear, or a wall. It may forever remain a hole in my memory - much like the footpath that ran down the back side of the house. I have absolutely no recollection of the footpath existing, and yet in cine film that appeared twenty or so years later, there was the path, and a sudden realisation that you really cannot trust memory at all.

I have countless memories playing in the back garden with my brother and his friends.

I remember picking a large toy rubber spider up one day that had been left out in the grass, not realising it had been sitting on an ants nest. After having something of a fit, brushing imaginary ants from my clothes and hair as one might if putting flames out, I composed myself and returned with a bucket and spade. I hit the bejeesus out of that poor rubber spider in order to rid it of ants, and pretty successfully dismembered it in the process.

I also remember our chocolate box cat decimating the population of racing pigeons being bred by a house that backed onto us, and my Mum clearing the feathers up so we didn’t get into trouble.

One of the highlights of being five years old was almost certainly hearing the distant chimes of the Ice Cream van as it approached, and racing to find my parents to ask if I could get one. Apparently my older brother once hung out of the window as Dad walked off to the van, and shouted “I WANT ONE WITH A HANDLE ON” (he meant a cornet).

For most of my formative years, Dad was building a boat on the driveway. In a scene not dissimilar to Gibbs in the TV Show NCIS, he would come home from work, eat his dinner, and then spend his evening building a bit more of the boat. We would “help” him.

I can very clearly remember one evening - shortly before heading to my grandparents to visit (we always visited on Tuesday nights) both myself and my brother were trying to get off the boat at once after “helping” Dad. I have a very clear memory of being shoulder barged, and falling to the left, off the ladder, and onto the concrete of the drive. I can’t remember being at the dentist, but I do remember the story being related to my Gran as I sat in her house with a mouth full of wadding later that evening. Apparently my mouth had filled with blood pretty spectacularly after splitting my lip on the ladder, the boat, and the floor.

One evening - while doing whatever it is that five year olds do while carrying out secret missions outside the back door of their house, the Ice Cream man stopped his van to talk to my Dad. He leaned out of the hatch on the side of the van and shouted “I wish I could get out of the van to come and have a look!”. And so the belief was formed in my young mind that Ice Cream men lived in their vans. I have never been allowed to forget this moment for the rest of my life - it became a part of the payload related to my future wife when she first met my parents. Of course now I have my own children, and will one day delight in telling similar stories to their potential suitors.

The Ice Cream Man origin story wasn’t the only thing I got wrong when I was young. One lunchtime, my Dad came home from work and was making a ball out of two different coloured lumps of Play-Doh that were left on the kitchen table. He made one thumb bowl red, and the other thumb bowl blue, before joining them together and admiring his handiwork. I watched him throughout in that way small children do, and was finally handed the finished product.

“This is the world”, he said. “On this side is England, where we live, and on the other side, is America, where Uncle John lives”.

And so it was that for years I believed the world was red and blue when viewed from space, and consisted of two countries - England, and America.

Uncle John was a huge figure in our young lives. He was my Mum’s brother, and had left to work in the merchant navy after several failed marriages. Of course we knew none of this - we just knew he now lived in America, and came to visit every couple of years bearing the kinds of gifts we could only imagine. He also looked like Popeye, which added an immediate appeal to any five year old of that era.

On Thursdays an open-air market would take place in the centre of town, filled with row upon row of knock-off clothes stalls, brick-a-brack stalls, dodgy electrical goods stores, and all manner of other questionable items. Being so young, I would be fixed to my Mum’s side as she held clothes against her, and bartered with the often Indian or Pakistani stall holders. My Grandparents would visit on Thursdays on their way home from the market - my Grandad on his moped, or my Gran on her bicycle. My brother took great delight in pedalling the moped up and and down the drive while my Mum told him off repeatedly. Quite often he would leave with Grandad, sitting on his lap on the moped with no helmet - to visit their house for the afternoon. I can’t imagine what a police officer would do these days if witnessing such an act.

In the centre of town stood a particular shop that essentially sold dreams to all the children in the area. It was owned by the Giles family. A toy shop. If given a piece of paper and a pencil, I could draw you the exact layout of Giles toy shop as it stood in the late 1970s right now. I could tell you what was in each aisle. From stationary, to plaster-of-paris figuirines, airfix model kits, star wars figures, pre-school toys, action figures, bicycles - you name it - I could tell you what they had. On a Saturday we would march into the shop brandishing our pocket money, and peruse the entire contents of the shop for what seemed like hours (it probably was hours). In reality we could only ever afford a dinky toy car because money burned holes in our pockets so fast we couldn’t possibly save it - but we would still look at all the things we couldn’t afford anyway.

Looking back, my Dad would have been taking us to the toy shop before dropping in at the local pub where his parents lived for the hour it opened on a Saturday lunchtime. Another source of countless memories that will have an entire chapter devoted to it. No wonder he used to grow impatient with us. I have very strong memories of playing with the Corgi helicopter from “Chopper Squad” in the garden of the pub. Chopper Squad was an imported television show where a rescue team essentially repeated the same story every single week, and we ate it up.

By far my favourite toy growing up was “Action Man”. I the US, the comparable line of toys would probably have been “G I Joe”. Action Man figures stood about 8” tall, and typically came in either adventure/explorer clothing, or in various soldier uniforms. They had bristly hair on their heads, a scar on their cheek, and later models had “gripping hands”, and “eagle eyes” (a lever at the back of their head caused their eyes to look left and right when manipulated).

Over time (birthdays and christmases) myself and my brother amassed further uniforms, weapons, and vehicles for your action man figures - but nothing really compared to the Christmas at Burswin Road when Dad must have hit the jackpot or something. We’re talking about a chieftain tank, an armoured car, an assault tower with a zip line, and a working submarine. The zip line alone caused absolute mayhem around the house, with balls of wool quickly substituting for the zip line that came with it - wool that would rapidly be wound around every door handle in the house, forming a spiders web that nobody taller than about 3ft could pass.

The zip lines were not the most dangerous Action Man accessory though - that prize goes to the replica second world war field gun that fired rubber tipped bullets some considerable distance. In the manner of most small children we would often get up incredibly early on Saturday mornings, and completely wreck the lounge before my parents appeared. I have very clear memories indeed of sitting in wait in the middle of the lounge, with the field gun armed, and aimed directly at the bedroom door. At the first signs of moment, a salvo would be fired the length of the lounge - either hitting Dad on the arse, or slamming against the opened door and skittering into the bedroom as he stomped off towards the kitchen to make breakfast.

It wasn’t ALL about Action Man though - even if he did look awesome. There was another TV show during those years that spawned the most awesome toy any of us had ever seen - The “Six Million Dollar Man”.

From memory, a military test pilot called Steve Austin (played by Lee Majors, who was married to Farrah Fawcett for a time at the height of their respective fames - the Brad and Angelina of their day) crashed a test plane and was horifically injured. It just so happened that there was a secret test going on with robotic body parts, and Steve was an ideal test case. In the words of the TV show intro - “we have the technology, we can rebuild him”. In reality, The Six Million Dollar Man was a ridiculous fore-runner of the likes of The A-Team, where the show’s budget meant the only “bionic” things Steve did were either in slow motion (he could run faster than a sports car), or via a zoom lens (he had a robot eye). It’s worth noting that Lee Majors had a squint, which was used to great effect when using his “Bionic Eye” - quite how I didn’t also enter adult life with the same squint is a miracle really, given the hours I spent squinting my way through imaginary adventures in our back garden.

Anyway! (got sidetracked there) - The Six Million Dollar Man spawned quite possibly the most awesome action figure that ever went on sale. Not only could you look through his head to see through a zoom lens in his eye, you could also peel back the skin on his arm to reveal robotics, and press a button in his back to ratchet his arm upwards - displaying his robot muscle strength for all to see. We never did figure out why the doll couldn’t do things like winching the couch, the dinner table, or the cat into the air though.

There are so many stories I could tell about growing up at 4 Burswin Road - like running into the house while bursting for the toilet as fast as my five year old legs could carry me, and ending up in the bedroom instead of the bathroom, wondering what the hell was going on (the two rooms were next to each other off the hallway).

I shared a bedroom with my brother - our beds were on opposite sides of the room. He had a huge wooden toybox at the end of his bed with a lid that required the strength of Hercules to lift open, and that always seemed might chop your fingers clean off it it came down on you. Looking back, it was probably no more than a blanket box, but it seemed cavernous. I had a chest of drawers at the end of my bed, which I would sit on while reading out instructions to my brother as he jumped on the beds like an Olympic gymnast - invariably reading out clever sounding aerial maneouvers from a copy of Brer Rabbit held upside down.

I found the copy of Brer Rabbit years later, and discovered some rather impressive Captain Scarlett, and Star Wars spaceships secretly drawn inside the covers. Drawing and colouring were a huge part of our childhood - I imagine because they kept us occupied, and didn’t cost much to do. I would draw on anything - old bits of wallpaper, the edges of the newspaper - whatever was to hand. If my Nan loaned me her bingo pen to draw with I thought I was bee’s knees (does anybody even use that expression any more?).

Our bedroom opened onto the hallway, one turn away from the lounge, and a short walk to the kitchen. I remember getting up late at night once to steal pickled onions from the kitchen table, and getting my hand stuck in the jar. I didn’t quite have the motor skills, or the intelligence to let go of the handful of pickles in order to make my escape.

I don’t really remember the kitchen table, which is strange - because I do remember sitting at it for all manner of adventures. If we had egg and beans at dinner time, I would mop up the yolk and sauce with a piece of bread, pretending I was product testing a new kitchen floor cleaner before popping it in my mouth (true story! - I was quite, quite mad). I also remember fighting over leftover cake mixture with my brother - and one night in particular when it all ended in tears.

It’s funny how specific memories remain crystal clear. I remember having my hands on one side of the glass bowl, and remember my brother sitting with his back to the door, gripping the other side of the bowl. I can also remember losing the battle, and watching the glass bowl whistle past my brother in slow motion before exploding on the tiled floor below.

I will never forget my Mum’s words:

Well now nobody is having any. Bed! NOW!

One of my more fond memories of Burswin Road was almost certainly pretending I was interested in football to stay up and watch Match of the Day. In reality I thought football was as dull as ditch water (and still do), but thought myself tremendously clever in my deceit. I only knew one player’s name - Kevin Keegan - and only then because Dad thought he was the best on the Superstars TV show.

Of course Kevin Keegan paled in comparison to Evil Kinevil, but that’s another story, for another chapter.</Text>

</Synopsis>
            <Text>The junior school that you walked through to reach the infant school was built in the post war years, and very much resembled a collection of military buildings - long, thin sheds subdivided into classrooms, with high windows - preventing children from seeing out to the playground. The buildings bordered the playground on adjacent sides, and were later partnered by a hall, and further classrooms in the 1960s.

The classrooms were warm in the summer, and cold in winter - heated by post war plumbing that rarely worked - huge cast-iron radiators lined the walls, and would break your kneecaps if you caught them while walking past.

Between the classrooms, long tiled corridors led out to the playground, and to the boys and girls bathrooms. The corridors were lined with benches, and coat hooks - usually festooned with hundreds of coats, scarves, gloves, and hats. We were supposed to have an assigned peg in the hallway, but one or two children would entirely disregard that plan.

My first teacher in junior school was called Mr Hannant. He was charming, funny, and a favourite with all the mums at the school gates. He was fairly short, stocky, sported an impressive moustache, and neat mop of black hair. He decorated his classroom with various shapes made from cut and folded paper - octohedrons, decahedrons, dodecahedrons, and so on. Looking back, it must have taken him hours to make them all.

Mr Hannant would sit on his desk to tell stories for the last half-hour of each day - swinging his legs as he read. I remember him reading 101 Dalmations one term, and use all becoming swept up in the story - breathlessly telling our parents about each day's adventure after the bell rang.

At the end of each day, the teachers would walk their class out to the school gates, where parents waited for their arrival. For many of the parents, those few minutes were their only chance of social interaction during the week - and boy did they take advantage of it. Every afternoon you would find endless children hanging from their Mum or Dad's sleeve, asking if they were going home yet.

"Soon".

Mr Hannant inspired all sorts of wonder in us at 7 years old. In the school hall there were a number of pieces of gymnastics apparatus that could be wheeled along tracks in the ceiling for PE lessons - I can still remember watching him climb a rope hand-over-hand - that single act lifted him up alongside Superman.

Outside of school, Mr Hannant also presented the early morning show on the local radio station. One of our school trips took us to visit the station, and meet the various presenters. A new student that had just started at the station gave us all a photo of him jumping off the roof - his name was Timmy Mallet, and he would go on to become a stalwart of childrens television years later. He now lives about ten miles from me - it's funny how life works out.

The only time we spent apart from our teacher at Junior school was to go and sing in the school choir. You had two choices with regard to the school choir - you either went to choir, or you went to choir. Not really much of a choice then. Looking back, your time with the music teacher was a chance for teachers to go and get a coffee, and a break from their class for a few minutes - except Mr Hannant invariably joined us in the hall to sing along with us all.

The Music Teacher was a stalwart of music hall theatre called Mrs Coates. It seemed she had starred on the stage at some point earlier in her career, and was somehow bitter about now teaching music to children who either could not, or would not sing to a level she was happy with. She had long dark hair, and enormous breasts. Even at 7 years old I knew she had enormous breasts, and it's not something I typically notice. She would bark at us all to "Sit up straight, smile, and sound your esses!", while playing the upright piano in the corner of the hall like a dimented machine gunner.

Along with Mrs Coates, and Mr Hannant, we learned to sing all manner of songs that generations of school children before us had also learned - standards, ballads, and unfortunately a number of church prescribed songs trumpeting God's might, and how our soldiers would defeat everybody who questioned him. Those songs were eventually banned.

I followed my brother through the junior school - he was three years ahead of me, meaning that we crossed paths for one year. I still remember the day I had forgotten my PE kit, so had to visit his classroom and ask if I might borrow his. I arrived at his teacher's desk - an imposing tyrant called Mr Lock - and only then noticed that not only my trousers on inside out, they were also on backwards. Thankfully Mr Lock said nothing.

As far as I recall, we did PE in our underwear if indoors - which would probably get schools shut down these days. The hall would be transformed into a gymnasium, with ropes, rings, a trapese, a vaulting horse, and all manner of crash mats. I remember being envious of the children that could climb the ropes up to the ceiling - I was hopeless at it.

The hall was also used for "Country Dancing" - a regular activity where guided dances were dictated from a tape player on a trolley - calling out rote moves over and over again. Although we all said we hated it, we secretly enjoyed it, and always put in as much effort as possible. I can still remember a sequence of steps called a "do-se-do" to this day.

What else do I remember about my time at Junior school? Oh yes - the desks! The desks were wooden, and half of the surface folded, to expose a storage drawer underneath. The drawer under my desk typically contained a few books, my handwriting pen (which had to be earned), and a star wars figure. Most children had a toy car, or some other small thing. The desks all had an ink-well in the far corner too - a throwback from an earlier time. Thankfully by the time I went to school, rollerball pens had become the norm. It's worth noting that we were not allowed to use biros - only school issued "handwriting pens".

My Mum kept many of my school exercise books, and gave them to me when I moved away from home. They are pretty entertaining. One book is titled "Weekend News", with room on each page for a picture, and a sentence of writing. Almost every weekend is filled with a total and utter work of fiction - telling stories of things that almost certainly never happened. One page in particular is telling though - a very detailed account of watching a Godzilla movie on TV, with a spectacular scene drawn above. The school project work books didn't always related facts accurately either - according to me, the Lancaster Bomber had a range of about five miles. That's going to be quite limiting, isn't it - only being able to bomb the enemy when they get within eye poking distance...

My memories of Junior school are almost all positive. I moved from Mr Hannant to Miss Hughes, Mr Lock, and then Miss Edge before leaving for secondary school. I remember some days with particular affection - like the day Miss Hughes wheeled the school television into the classroom for us all to watch the first launch of the Space Shuttle - or the day Mrs Ellis returned to teach us for one day - or the times Miss Edge read us fantastical stories while perched on the benches at the end of her classroom.

Miss Edge was a newly qualified student teacher, who taught me during my final year of junior school. She drove a Citroen 2CV, which she parked at the end of the school playground. She had a shock of red frizzy hair, was slender in build, and typically wore flowing dresses covered in Laura Ashley flower patterns. She may as well have been called "Mrs Lovely". A favourite memory is of her inventing math questions involving numbers of kangaroo burgers, or other such made-up foods.

Only recently I discovered that Mr Lock and Miss Edge eventually got married. This kind of stunned me, because you couldn't imagine two people more different than each other. Mr Lock was a tall, imposing, frightening teacher. He terrified my brother, and caused a visit by my parents to visit the headmaster about his teaching methods (fear, intimidation, and cruelty, if my brother was to be believed). Here's the thing though - my brother is the only person I've ever heard tell such stories about him.

I met Mr Lock years later, driving the bus to college. He smiled, but didn's say anything. I often wonder why he left teaching, and became a bus driver - was my brother right? Or had he finally had enough of pulling crayons from children's noses ?

Throughout junior school my best friends were Jamie Blackwell, and Claire Goodman. Both Jamie and Claire were the children of local police officers - it may surprise you to learn that this only just occurred to me. Claire lived across the road from me, and had a little sister called Anna. She insisted her real name was “Fred”, but her own family all called her “Sid”. I’ve never actually questioned why, or even thought to question why - I guess when you’re young you just take information on-board without really questioning it.

At the end of junior school, Claire went to a different secondary school than me, so we almost became strangers overnight - it’s funny how that happens. Where we had spent countless evenings and summers in each other’s company, suddenly we were reduced to occasional waves if we left the house at the same time as each other. Our favourite dinner lady on the school playground called us “you lovebirds” on more than one occasion - causing burning red faces, and more than a few awkward moments.

Dinner ladies. Who remembers the ladies that watched over the playground at lunchtime? In the world I grew up in, dinner ladies came out of some kind of “dinner lady mold” - complete with a large wool coat, sheep skin lined boots, and a small upset child attached to at least one hand as they wandered through the sea of children like a first world war battleship. They always seemed to be sturdy, yet softly spoken women of a certain age - sometimes sporting the type of battleship hairdo I had only previously seen at the bingo hall. My favourite dinner lady was called “Mrs Daily” (or Daley - I’m not sure of the spelling). She always had a kind word, and would seemingly spot trouble entire minutes before it actually occurred. Her hair was always pulled up into a bun, with a long fringe swept neatly to one side with hair-grips. She always wore a quilted three-quarter length coat, and huge mittens - at least in my memory.

I don’t really remember my last day at junior school - or infant school for that matter. I’m not really sure why. All I do remember is the tremendous excitement felt throughout the class when the summer holidays approached. I also remember my year six teacher crying on the last day as she said goodbye to us all.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Memories of primary school - the place, the teachers, fellow pupils.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Apparently my start a infant school didn’t go well. I was pretty determined at 5 years old that I wasn’t going to be going to school, thankyou very much, and my Mum would be coming to get me - which she did for the first few days - to take me home for lunch, and then back in again.

Thinking back, it must have been a bit of a nightmare - we lived well over a mile from the school, so no sooner had my Mum got home after dropping me off on a morning, she would have had to turn around, and walk back again. Obviously at some point I realised there was far too much walking back and forth involved, and decided that staying at school would be far easier - mostly for me.

The school I attended was one of four in the town - and perhaps the biggest. After entering through the main gates, you would walk through the junior school playground, and on towards the infant buildings on the far side. Most of the early years classrooms were built in the 1960s along the edge of a tarmac playground lined - which doubled as a netball court - with telegraph pole benches around it’s perimeter. Rather mysteriously, there were climbing frames on the school field alongside that we were never allowed to touch. It was very frustrating.

My first teacher was a bubbly lady by the name of Mrs Hollenberg. I don’t remember her face - just her mass of curly red-brown hair, and the huge flowery dresses she wore. I also remember her cutting letters of the alphabet from pages of broad-sheet newspapers, and pinning them to the walls of the classroom.

A little way through my first year of infant school, it became obvious why Mrs Hollenberg wore the giant flowery dresses - she was rather heavily pregnant. We arrived in class one day to discover she had been replaced by a tall, young, elegant, and looking back, beautiful lady with jet black hair called Mrs Ellis.

Until Mrs Ellis had a car crash.

I remember our teacher changing again - to a Mrs Komenick, who all the parents at the school gate adored, and I can remember Mrs Ellis returning to work some weeks later. We were to be careful of brushing against her legs on account of her injuries. She and another teacher - Mrs Woodcock - had been in the car, and both of them seriously injured. Of course none of this was communicated on to us at the time - we found out years later.

My only real memory of Mrs Ellis is that she was quite strict. This may have had quit a lot to do with my propensity to daydream. I was good at daydreaming - I still am. Where most people have distracting thoughts, I seem to have an entire theatre of the mind going on - playing out scenes that haven’t happened and probably never will happen in their entirety.

I suppose there is one other memory - but I’m not sure if it’s to do with my teacher’s injuries, or a very early sense of “I shouldn’t be doing this”. During story time one day, while a group of us sat on a rug to listen to Mrs Ellis read from a story book in that upside down fashion that teachers are so good at, she needed to get up and fetch something - so strode over the top of us all, picking her way through the gaps between us, her skirt billowing as she did so. Myself and a friend looked up as she passed overhead - on purpose. Here’s the funny thing - I have absolutely no memory of what we saw, but I do remember looking at my friend wide-eyed as we sat cross-legged, and giggling at our own bravery and/or stupidity.

You’ll be glad to know that was my only such brush with such goings on - I didn’t progress to dropping things underneath girls skirts, or playing kiss chase on the field at lunchtimes in the summer.

Each day - after arriving at school, we would gather in the school hall, sitting cross-legged on the herring bone patterned wooden flooring, and listen to the headmaster as he made announcements, and probably picked something witty or interesting to say from a book of witty and interesting things to say for headmasters. He was a frightening man if you were five years old - perhaps sixty-something years old, always in an immaculate suit, slicked back hair, and a tiny moustache. Kind of a more friendly version of Hitler, I suppose. He drove a lumbering Jaguar to school - the kind you sometimes see criminals drive in 1950s movies starring Lesley Phillips and Terry Thomas.

What we didn’t know about W.R.Tull (that was his name) was that he had been a Lancaster bomber navigator during the second world war. We found this out when my brother took a model aircraft he had been building into school, and was accosted by Mr Tull while showing it to his friends. A sea of children gathered around him as he told stories about ditching in the sea, and floating on the waves in inflatable boats until help arrived. He pointed out the panel on the side of the plane where the boat was stored, and we all listened in stunned (and frightened) silence.

Getting back to the school hall, if you had achieved anything of note during the school day, you would be invited to stand at the front and receive the congratulations of the rest of the school - every day names were read out, and certificates handed out by the headmaster, one at a time, to thunderous applause. He read out the names from a lectern at the side of the stage area.

I got to stand on the stage perhaps four or five times during my time at junior school - for various smimming certificates, and to act out a parable from the bible with the rest of my class.

Our school had a swimming pool! How could I forget that! For such a small school (there were perhaps three hundred pupils across years one to six) to have a swimming pool was unusual to say the least - it had been paid for by fundraising by parents over several years, and the school was very, very proud of it.

The pool was in an unheated out-building, on the edge of the school field. It was ten metres long, by five metres wide, and about as deep as an adult’s hips (not very deep at all). The walls were painted white, with a mural running all the way around with under-sea scenes - octopi, fish, coral reefs, and even Poseidon, if memory serves. The boys and girls changing rooms were communal (we were only five, remember) - although there was a half-height dividing wall between the benches where the girls and boys would get changed. If we stood on the benches to look over at the girls getting changed, the instant screams would alert teachers, and we would find ourselves in all sorts of trouble.

It’s funny how punishments form such a big part of your memory of your early school years - even if you rarely found yourself in trouble. At my school if you did anything ridiculous at break-time or lunchtime, you would find yourself “in the middle”. This referred to a small circle painted in the centre of the playground, that was kind of the real-world equivalent of the phantom zone that General Zod got confined to in Superman. You had to stand in the circle for the rest of playtime, and a teacher would deal with you afterwards. Nobody was allowed to talk to anybody standing “in the middle”, and if you were “in the middle”, you were not allowed to talk to anybody else. To be honest, it was incredibly rare that anybody ended up standing in the imaginary purgatory - I only did once, as far as I can remember - for squirting a dinner-lady with a fake flower ring filled with water. I thought I was tremendously funny until I saw her reaction. I can’t imagine how the teacher kept a straight face while telling me how disappointed she was in my behaviour.

Perhaps the most humorous “in the middle” episode happened a couple of years later - when I was in the juniors. At the end of playtime, all of the children would form into class lines at the edges of the playground, ready to be walked back into class by our teachers. This of course left anybody standing in the middle doing exactly that - standing in the middle - waiting for a member of staff to approach, question, and express their disappointment. There was this one time though, when the boy standing in the middle decided he had had enough of it all - and rather than listen to the aerated teacher rant at him (he was a well known lunatic of a child), he turned and ran. I can still see the teacher racing off after him across the playground, and catching him after a few strides - lifting him with huge hands around his upper arms, and his legs still running in midair as he was marched - still running - towards the head-master’s office. Shocked and stunned whispers murmured all around the playground for quite some time before we all began filing in for afternoon lessons.

That same little boy died in a car crash years later. He passed his driving test, and days later killed himself, and very nearly killed his friends while driving like a lunatic. I’ve often wondered if he might have been an example of nature versus nurture. His parents were lovely, and his brother was lovely - he became one of my best friends - but his little brother was an absolute lunatic, and everybody knew it.

Another memory of infant school was the school tuck-shop. At the beginning of break-time each day, you were allowed to venture to the adjoining junior-school playground, and visit their tuck-shop, that sold packets of crisps (invariably the cheapest crisps available from whichever retailer), and foil-wrapped cookies called “Mojo”s. Each item only cost a few pence, and the shop was run by students, who took turns to be shop-keeper for the day - I’ll get back to this later. I can still remember the day - at about six years old - when Sarah Bates arrived back in our classroom during a wet playtime, in floods of tears. The crisps had gone up in price by 1 pence, meaning she didn’t have enough money to buy any. It took her quite some time to calm down enough to tell the teacher what had happened.

            <Title>Thought Cafe</Title>
            <Text>Back in the early days of the internet, if you signed up for a service such as Compuserve, or America Online, not only would you be charged a monthly membership fee, you would also pay for the cost of the phone call to connect to their service. Over time those costs were folded into the membership fees, but it was still limiting - the world wide web appeared, and they acted as gatekeepers.

The solution to all of this was the “Internet Service Provider” - rather than connect to a walled garden service such as Compuserve, and then leave to connect to the World Wide Web, or to fetch your email with a client such as Eudora, an Internet Service Provider just sold you a connection to the internet - usually for an amount per month, on a phone number that carried no further charges.

This was still in the age of modems, remember, where you took over the phone line completely when connecting to the internet. While you were online, nobody could call you - which I suppose was a blessing if you were avoiding calls from anybody in particular.

Shortly after signing up with an internet service provider at home, I received a marketing call from them, offering a quantity of webspace as part of the package. I had no idea what I might need webspace for, and joked with the sales person about it - they explained that more and more people were building their own pages on the world wide web - that it was becoming “a thing”. I declined the offer, still laughing, and thought no more about it.

Until a few days later.

While noodling around on the internet one evening, the idea of having my own page had obviously been churning around at the back of my mind, and I followed my nose until I discovered a site called “Geocities” where you could build your own page. Sure, it would be filled with advertising, and other junk, but most of the page was yours to do what you wanted with.

I instantly imagined myself as an elite hacker (that only just knew how to switch a computer on), and chose the name “toxicshock”. I thought myself tremendously clever for a few evenings - beavering away at building a page, and learning enough HTML to build a few pages out. I then emailed a few friends, sending them the URL - expecting them to be stunned with my virtuoso display. Suffice to say nobody replied.

It got me thinking though - about what I might build on the web if I did it properly. I sat up again one night, and built out a page on the free webspace now being given away by the web service provider. I thought it might be fun to create an online magazine website of sorts - filled with all my thoughts about things. It would all be static content, but I could add more pages and upload to it over time. I called it “Thought Cafe”.

The static page sat there for months, and I told nobody about it. I still have a copy of it on a ZIP disk somewhere - I should really dig it out, and store it for prosperity.

Perhaps a year later - after moving into my own apartment, I was at a loose end one evening, and realised I could write programming that would in turn generate the pages of a website. I tried it out - building myself a database with a table for stories, and the programming to loop through them, and build out pages for each story, and an index page. It worked!

Over the course of a weekend I built it out further, adding authors, and content categories, and announced it to anybody I knew - inviting them to submit content. The resulting pages went online at some point in 1999, still called “ThoughtCafe”. The crazy thing? People browsing the world wide web started to discover it - either by chance, or word of mouth, and a steady trickle of email started to arrive - people sending their writing in to be showcased on the site.

You have to remember this was a long time before blogs existed. The social internet wasn’t even a vague idea. I was just making a magazine website.

I would copy people’s writing into the database, fill out their author details, and run the program - which would spit all the pages out - with author pages, bibliographies, article pages, and so on. I thought myself tremendously clever, but going through the daily grind of entering new content for everybody, and re-building the website was a huge bind. There had to be a better way.

I discovered the “better way” while flicking through a magazine at work. Microsoft had released a new version of their web server software that supported running Visual Basic code to generate webpages. It just so happened that I had been using Visual Basic at work, and the company database was written with the same database engine that the new webserver used.

I spent the next several months building a new ThoughtCafe website - one where people could register themselves as members, file their own pieces, and comment on each other’s writing. Although quiet at first, the new website picked up momentum over the course of several months until I was regularly crashing the webserver. It turned out that although Microsoft were pretty good at building desktop operating systems, they were hopeless at building server operating systems - as evidenced by the daily crashes under the load of perhaps a hundred people.

Despite the instability, the website grew like a weed. Within a few months there were a thousand members, and I had stopped writing anything myself. I spent my time developing new features, babysitting disputes between members, and trying to improve what was already there. Around the same time I met a girl, and she started a monthly newsletter for the members - as intoxicated as I was in the community we had accidentally created. The newsletter showcased the most popular writing of the last month, introduced new authors, and included articles about the craft of writing. We even had a few interviews along the way.

At some point in perhaps 2001, the instability problems finally caused me to snap. A curious mixture of technologies known as “LAMP” were rapidly becoming the standard for web development, so I ordered a stack of books from Amazon to learn everything I could.

LAMP was an acronym - standing for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. Linux was the server operating system, Apache the webserver, MySQL the database server, and PHP the programming language that the webserver could use to turn static pages into dynamic ones.

The O’Reilly books arrived through the post a few days later, and I became a recluse for a while - building out all the things you expect to see in websites - registration pages, login pages, email confirmations, and so on. It’s worth talking a little about the O’Reilly books. Back in the early days of the world wide web, there was little or no documentation available, because it was developing so fast, but the time a book came out it would be obsolete. A company called O’Reilly decided to correct this, and started printing a series of huge tomes that covered each of the emerging technologies and platforms - often in exhaustive detail. They had no problem with re-issuing the books repeatedly, year on year - with updates to cover any changes along the way. The books were all white, and had pen-and-ink illustrations on the covers - usually of animals, but not always. I remember one with a koala bear, another with a platypus, and another with a cowboy on a rearing horse.

After several months of development alongside babysitting the old website, I migrated everybody’s writing over, emailed out their passwords, and the new site appeared on the internet for the first time at some point early in the summer of 2001. It flew, it was stable, everybody loved it, and the membership growth went off the chart. Within weeks the site was features in a magazine, and schools started signing pupils up to get feedback on their writing.

It was a heady time - and perhaps the end of a period of innocence for the world wide web. A few months after launch - with several thousand people logging in each day - trouble started to brew. Some of the authors had begun fighting in the forums (oh yes, I forgot - I built forums into the new site too - and blogs, which were the new “thing” that every site had to have).

After some investigation, we discovered what was going on, and it was kind of heartbreaking. People were joining with several accounts, starting arguments with themselves, and then stoking the fires they started. I presented the evidence - in public on the site - and name and shamed several of the people involved. One of them held his hands up, and claimed he had been performing a social experiment - researching human behaviour. I banned him, and he re-joined minutes later from the same IP address.

The site continued to run for the next four or five months, with sporadic outbreaks of trouble, and then one day I sat doing some housekeeping in the back end of the site, looked across at my other half, sat next to me with her laptop, and said “this isn’t fun any more, is it”.

We announced the closure of the site a week later.

I don’t regret building ThoughtCafe at all. It taught me a lot about building websites, and about human nature. Sure, some of the lessons were unpleasant, but they were in the minority. In some ways the site was “of it’s time” too - blogs had emerged, along with a new site in the US called “The Facebook”, another called “LiveJournal”, and another called “MySpace” that everybody was flocking to. It didn’t take long for community sites such as forums, and discussion boards to vanish from the world wide web entirely - along with more esoteric internet platforms such as usenet, and IRC.

Of course it will surprise nobody that the knowledge gained from building ThoughtCafe was folded straight into another project - a blog solution. Rather than run anything, I wrote the code to power a blog, and gave it away as “Open Source”. It got downloaded a quarter of a million times. Another story for another day.</Text>

            <Title>RAF Brize Norton</Title>
            <Text>I grew up in Carterton - a small town in the Cotswolds, a few miles from Oxford. Carterton had been founded by a farmer called Carter a couple of hundred years before, and had grown over time. It was an “in-between” place. Witney, famous for wool and blankets was a little way away, and the various Wychwood villages - the inspiration for “The Shire” in Tolkien’s books - a few miles in the other direction.

When you tell somebody you’re from Carterton, they stare at you blankly. Then you tell them it’s near Brize Norton, and a flicker of recognition appears on their face.

You see, Carterton is dominated by a huge air base called “RAF Brize Norton”. Brize Norton is a small village a mile from Carterton - that touches the end of the runways. If you visit the air base though, you visit Carterton. There’s a simple reason for it too. When the air base was built, there was already an “RAF Cardington” elsewhere in the country - and on the radio “RAF Carterton” sounded far too similar - so they named the base after the tiny nearby hamlet of Brize Norton instead.

RAF Brize Norton is now the biggest military transport base in Europe. It also manages most of the military air traffic for western europe, I believe - I discovered this when I went with our next door neighbour to get a weather report before a flight in his training aircraft. We got into a lift at ground level, men-in-black style, and came out onto a room not unlike the room in Wargames - with projections of most of Europe on the screens, and vector plotters printing out huge supercomputer projections of weather systems.

As you might imagine, life in Carterton was dominated by the air base. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the base was shared by both the Royal Air Force, and the United States Air Force - who kept row upon row of B-52s lined up, ready to go.

If you have no idea what a B-52 is, think of a plane about the size of a 747, but with 8 engines instead of 4, several times louder, and designed to carpet bomb anything in sight. We got used to them taking off and landing - but visitors to the house would recoil in horror when the windows shook, and pictures rattled on the wall.

“What on earth is that noise?”

“What noise?”

Of course along with the United States Air Force came a small army of support personnel and their families. Suddenly there were American children living in our street - they talked funny, and had very different values than us. We all got along though - in the way kids do - and loved their Dad’s cars. One man at the end of the road flew his Triumph Spitfire over from the US - it had a plaque on the dashboard from a visit to Bonneville at some point during it’s life. It never occurred to me that his car had been imported into the US from the UK in the first place. Several of the US servicemen had Pontiac Trans-Ams, which you could feel approaching before you heard or saw them.

We loved playing with the American children, but most of them lived within the confines of the air base. Some families were forward thinking, and put their kids into schools in the town, but most went to the “on base” school. The base also got a huge investment from the USAF - building a bowling alley, a cinema, a nightclub, a supermarket full of American food, and countless other amenities that we all loved visiting as children. Unfortunately that all stopped years later when security was tightened beyond belief.

The air base became the scene of so many childhood adventures though - I couldn’t possibly count the number of bike rides we went on with friends around the outside of the base. We all knew exactly the right places to go to watch aircraft take off and land - and would sit in the grass, patiently waiting for them to pass overhead. We knew most of the VC-10s, many of the C-130 Hercules, and quite a few of the B-52s.

I remember one day at Primary School a flying officer from RAF Brize Norton visited our class to talk about his job. He wore his full flight suit, and we were all tremendously impressed with him. He had a full-face oxygen kit with him - that went under a flight helmet, and made you look a bit like Darth Vader - he called it a “Darth Vader” suit himself, and he wanted a volunteer to try it on. All the usual confident kids threw their hands up, and leaned out of their chairs - I almost didn’t bother because I knew I wouldn’t be picked - I was never picked. And he picked me. Looking back, his choosing me had a huge impact, because whenever I need to pick kids these days, I always try to choose the kid that might otherwise not be picked. I remember looking out over the class full of amazed children, and hearing my breath in my ears from the oxygen system. I really WAS Darth Vader for a few moments. I was also scared to death.

Eventually the United States pulled out of many of the UK bases, and retreated homewards - I suppose as the temperature with Russia cooled. Suddenly the town became much more quiet than it had been, and some of the facilities were closed - not that we were allowed to use them any more.

Just thinking back, there were some really odd thing that happened over the years too - like the time Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife visited the UK in the late 1980s. The roads they would be travelling on were re-surfaced overnight, the night before they arrived. Raisa - Mrs Gorbachev - visited my secondary school. The tarmac was still wet on the way into school that morning - and no roads were fixed for years afterwards - the entire budget had obviously been blown to pieces in one night.

I’m always reminded of a joke I heard - that the Queen thinks the world smells of wet paint.

The last time I visited the base was for a children’s birthday party at the swimming pool - for my nephew’s birthday. I still remember queueing at the gate with the other parents and children, being questioned by several guards with loaded rifles. Security gone mad.</Text>

            <Synopsis>Memories of the first Year, and Mr Way - the ultimate Renaissance man.
</Synopsis>
            <Text>I'm sitting here, trying to remember the most significant memories from my time at secondary school - and struggling somewhat. It's all become so fragmented - it feels like a collection of snapshots, stored away inside my head. The strange thing about memories is that they unlock each other - one recollection leads to another, and another.
 
Perhaps I can use the trail of breadcrumbs to my advantage - if I start with the first day at secondary school, hopefully the rest unfold somewhat naturally.
 
My first teacher at secondary school was called "Mr Way" - Martin Way. He was the prototypical history teacher - with a comb-over, a bushy beard, and a huge array of thick knitted tops that made him look like he might have just stepped from a north sea trawler. He was a wonderful artist, local historian, and perhaps the most knowledgeable teacher I've ever known. He didn't so much teach history, as bring it to life - I remember a scratch-built Roman helmet and shield in the corner of his tutor room throughout they years he taught me.
 
Perhaps the biggest change with moving to secondary school was walking between different classrooms for different subjects. While we started each week with Mr Way, our typical school-day took us from class-room to class-room throughout the day. A single lesson was about 35 minutes, and a double obviously double that. There was a morning break after the first two classes, a further two before lunch, and a another three afterwards.
 
I remember the first morning, sitting in Mr Way's classroom - and him handing out exercise books for every subject. We were to write our own name, and class at the top right corner of every book cover - on lines measured 1 centimeter from the top of the book, and from each other. Guess who wrote his name on the left side of every book before realising his mistake?
 
I remember using a fountain pen for the first time at secondary school. You were allowed to use either roller-balls, or fountain pens - no ballpoint pens. Of course the novelty factor meant that everybody had fountain pens for the first few weeks, and made a huge mess with them too. I dare not guess how many children ended up with ink stains in the lining of their blazers.
 
Oh yes - school uniforms! All secondary schools that I have ever known in the UK require a school uniform. I think uniforms were instituted to remove the entire question of means, or background - if everybody wears the same clothes, nobody can use their clothes to differentiate, or divide. Of course the uniform also meant that children could be identified and associated with the school while outside of school. We were reminded of this on a regular basis. In the first three years of secondary school everybody wore a dark blue tie with white strips. Beyond that, a red stripe was added to the white stripe. The only time I can ever remember the ties being checked was in the queue for the school canteen.
 
The school hall doubled as the canteen, with vast kitchens being hidden behind huge rolling blinds. At lunchtime, children buying lunch from the canteen queued along the corridor towards the hall, in year order - unless you were third year or above, in which case you could could go to the front of the queue. I seem to remember fifth years could jump the queue entirely.
 
At morning break-time the canteen sold crisps, drinks, fruit, chocolate bars, and an endless supply of chocolate cornflake balls. At lunchtime things were much more healthy - with curries, vegetables, chips, lasagne, or anything else that could be baked in a huge tray, to be honest. I think I probably lived on baked potatoes with beans for quite some time.
 
The tables in the hall were arranged into rows, with bench seats on either side - the same bench seats used in the morning for assemblies in the hall. Each class took it in turns to both set out, and put away the chairs and tables. Each table sat about ten people at a push - eight if you wanted any elbow room.

I remember the first time I visited the canteen - and meeting up with my older brother. I put all manner of things on my tray, with no regard for how much money it might cost - at primary school the food had been free. Luckily I had enough money, and have no clue what I would have done if I had not.

I remember a girl sitting next to my brother smiling, raising an eyebrow, and winking at me - obviously put up to it by him. I pulled an apparently hilarious face, judging by the immediate laughter, and disappeared inside myself for the rest of lunchtime, my face burning.

As the years passed by, I rarely bothered with lunch from the canteen - instead either taking my own sandwiches in, or walking to the local petrol station with friends to buy chocolate bars instead. Not exactly a wonderful diet - but I’m sure children still do it now if given the opportunity.

I remember following a few older boys - friends of my brother - into town one lunchtime, and being amazed that they went to the local chip shop. One of them went to the supermarket and bought a pint of milk - and drank it straight from the carton. In my little world this was rock-star behaviour.

Some of the secondary school teachers are burned into my memory far more clearly than others.

My first French teacher was called Mrs Wilson. She lived in a flat above the chemist in town, and was perhaps in her mid to late 20s with shoulder-length dark blonde hair, and a wardrobe of clothes that screamed sensible. In our first French lesson we had to pick French names for ourselves from a hat - I picked “Michel”, which caused the entire class to burst into laughter. This was years before I discovered Jean Michel Jarre. I retreated inside myself for that entire first lesson. I was terrible at languages - I still am. I think the only phrases I still recall involve pencil cases, ice creams, monkeys, gineau pigs, and trees. Not exactly conversational.

The English teacher was called Mrs Crossland - the mother of a girl I had gone all the way through infant and junior school with. Looking back, she was a wonderful teacher who fought valliantly to make us interested in both reading and writing - unfortunately at 11 years old I was just a bit too disinterested in anything that didn’t involve either computers or lego to care very much. She was slim, always smart, and had a piercing gaze that was impossible to avoid if you were messing around.

I remember once attempting to perform a huge chunk of a Shakespeare play with a group in class, and taking note that the previous group had been too static. During our turn, I tried to walk around a bit while reciting my lines (very badly, it should be added - I had the memory of a goldfish) - and was asked after we finished if I needed to go to the bathroom.

My first math teacher was called Mr Fitchew. A tall retired Royal Air Force pilot with grey hair, and a seemingly endless supply of shirt and cardigan sets. I bet they were Christmas presents from his family. He was always immaculately presented, with a booming voice, and a wicked sense of humor. I’ll never forget the afternoon - towards the end of my time at school - when one of the girls asked him (during an aside about his career in the RAF) if he had ever crashed.

“Yes - I actually survived several crashes”

“Did you have to ejaculate out of the window?”

We all knew what she meant to say, but the explosion of laughter around the room, and the grin on his face will be etched into my memory until I die. Of course - knowing what I now know about sixteen year old girls, the entire conversation could have been expertly steered towards the joke.

The music teacher was a large lady called Mrs Hawker who wore huge flowing dresses, had a mass of curly hair, wore huge glasses, and somehow controlled an uncontrollable rabble armed with noise making devices (read: musical instruments). I remember in the first few music lessons being asked to sing “Baa Baa Black Sheep”, to see if each of us could hold a tune - and being pants-wettingly terrified. Thankfully, after a childhood messing around on the upright piano at my grandparents house, and on my parents musical keyboards, I could “play a bit” - certainly enough to impress a few people in the music class.

A lasting memory of music were the once-monthly “record lessons” - where we were allowed to bring a pop record in, a track played to the class from each record of the teacher’s choosing, followed by questions about it. I can still remember David Langstaff bringing the gatefold “Thriller” album in, and the teacher dropping it - scratching it in the process. We all cringed as she picked it up - we could all see the scratch.

I grew to like Mrs Hawker. I carried on with music as an exam subject, even though I was a bit hopeless at it. I never did learn to sight read music, and never played with any of the school bands that formed among friends. I got continual requests to be a keyboard player, but I think that had more to do with them wanting to borrow stuff of my parents, than wanting me in the band.

The science teachers were an odd bunch. Mr White was perhaps the most strict - a tall, imposing man who always wore a suit and a lab-coat. He taught chemistry, and most people thought he was insane. He wove the most ridiculous stories (that we all believed) in order to teach the most boring parts of the subject - and had a particular talent for calling people by their names backwards.

You always had the sense that you shouldn’t cross Mr White - and this was proven when a boy from another class was brought to him to be disciplined one day - he quietly excused himself, and walked to an adjacent classroom, across the corridor. We could see him through two sets of windows, and the corridor - inches from the boy’s face, screaming at the top of his voice. I remember the boy’s face becoming slowly more purple, and tears trickling down his cheeks.

Mr Lloyd also taught chemistry, and had a somewhat spectacular record at setting up experiments that failed. I remember an entire lesson being wasted while he attempted to make hydrogen pop from a test-tube - finally explaining what should have happened. That happened a lot.

My first biology lessons were taught by a Welsh teacher called Mr Davies, who never bothered learning anybody’s names. Everybody was Jack, Jill, Flossy, or some other ridiculous 1950s Enid Blyton name. The strange thing was that we all knew when he was referring to us, even though he didn’t use our name. I remember being chosen to demonstrate the method of preparing a sample in agar jelly, in a petri-dish, and shaking so violently with nerves that one of the girls whispered “why is he shaking so much?” - Mr Davies immediately asked if she would like to also demonstrate, which caused her to almost climb inside her own shoes.

I don’t remember Mr Davies teaching us sex education, but I suppose he must have. It usually fell on the biology teacher. I remember it all being very serious, and the books being full of diagrams, and cut-away drawings of internal organs - not exactly the naughty pictures we had imagined it might involve.

We had two male PE teachers. I’m not entirely sure why. The first was a slight guy with a speech impediment - and I can’t remember his name at all. The other was a boisterous, loud, thick set guy that played rugby each weekend called Mr Clarke. Of course we learned to play rugby. Rugby was one of the few field sports I was any good at - mostly because I did as I was told. Unlike the more talented kids that ran sideways across the pitch (like the wind I might add), I would charge forward with the ball, crashing straight into the people ahead, setting up for a hand-off behind me - with echos of “Well done that man!” behind me.

The female PE teachers were gazed at from a distance. By all the boys. I remember one in particular - Miss Foot (later Mrs Clarke) taking part in sports day one year - running in a 100 metre relay against the fifth years (the seniors). It’s the first time I had seen anybody that could really run like she could - the entire field fell silent, with whispers of “Jesus” as she ran 100 metres in about 11 seconds - pulling back a 30 metre lead given away by teachers on previous legs.

Ever since I was little, I had been obsessed with drawing things - so it was no surprise at all that I was good at art. The art teacher from the second year on was called Miss Ritson, and was probably more artist, and less teacher. I thought the world of her. She was perhaps in her mid 30s by the time she taught me, and dressed in that way that art teachers so often do - with flowing shirts, jeans, and scarves. 

Art was one of the few subjects I was naturally good at - it probably still is. Even all these years later, if ever cornered into drawing anything for anybody, they wonder why I didn’t take up a career in art or design. I guess I just lost interest in it at some point. Although I went on to do art at college, I wonder if the first seeds of destruction were sewn by the popular girls in the art-class muttering behind my back when my work turned out better than theirs.

I remember one day we had to draw an old boot - a still life. At the end of the lesson the various drawings were pinned up to talk about - I think we had only been allowed to use line - no shading. One of the girls pointed at mine:

“Oh my god - look at that one - who drew that!”

“Oh. It was him.”

There was a tone. A tone I’ve still not forgotten, thirty-something years later.

I took history as an exam subject, and remember the first lesson with the “proper” history teacher - a bold man with white hair around his collar called “Mr McCollugh”. The children called him “Dungeon Master” behind his back. He talked at length about sporting events that had happened over the summer, about movies that had come out, about the various news stories in the paper recently. We thought we were getting away with doing nothing for the entire lesson - then as the bell rang, he stood up, and asked us all.

“What have we been talking about today?”

There was a murmuring around the room.

“History. We have been talking about history.”

He smiled, and we all stared at him. Some of us got it, some didn’t care, and some still had no clue. You can’t win them all, I suppose.

I remember a wonderful female teacher called Mrs Porter, that taught history, sociology, and various other subjects that commonly got wrapped up as “social studies”. One day - while starting a new topic about prejudice, and persecution - she asked us what we thought about Jews. Bit by bit, the children in the class volunteered more and more things they had been told, or learned from others - that they had big noses - black hair - wore waistcoats - just about every stereotypical prejudicial trait you might ever think of. After filling the board with everything volunteered, she looked at us all, without a hint of hurt, or reaction.

“I’m a Jew”.

That moment has stayed with me. I can remember the silence that followed, and the ring-leaders that had volunteered so many things wanting the ground to open up beneath them.

When I started at the school, the headmaster was a tall, gangly old man called Kenneth Mumford. He had an impressive moustache, and perhaps the most creased face I have ever seen. He told endless stories about visiting India to meet Mother Teresa, and banged on about bible stories whenever he lead assemblies. My only real experience of him was while queueing for PE one day - one of the boys in my class sprayed another boy in the face with deodorant - and Mr Mumford saw it happen. He immediately threatened the perpetrator with the cain (which we all thought had been banned several years previously).

Mr Mumford eventually retired, and was replaced by a very young headmaster called Jeremy Cunningham. He was very obviously a product of either Oxford or Cambridge, and it showed in everything he said, or did. He wore quite possibly the thickest glasses I’ve ever seen, and was also the most clumsy, awkward person too. To introduce himself to the school, he played an acoustic guitar in assembly and sang. It must have taken some guts, because he wasn’t very good. When he finished, he looked out at us all, sitting in rows, and said “Good morning everyone”. We obviously didn’t respond very volubly, so he repeated his greeting.

“Good MORNING everyone!”

Suddenly a single boy’s voice returned his greeting, shouting as loud and comically as possible:

“GOOD MORNING!”

There was a stunned silence, after which the gathering proceeded as-per-normal - with notices of things going on around the school, and so on. Finally the headmaster bade us farewell, and we all stood and prepared to leave.

Mr Bradley shouted at everybody to sit down again, then strode directly towards the boy that had shouted.

“STAND UP. NOW!”

I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more furious teacher, a more purple face, or a louder voice. We all sat with goggle eyes, unable to take our eyes off the dismantling happening right in front of us. The boy that had shouted was one of the popular kids - one of the kids that always seemed to get away with everything. Only this time he didn’t, and his stock sank like a stone. All of the formerly adoring girls watched as he burst into tears while the teacher ranted in his face - explaining to everybody that if you did anything in your life, don’t be like this guy.

            <Synopsis>Memories of college - of the place, the teachers, the subjects, the pupils. Not fitting in. The G-Block foyer!</Synopsis>
            <Text>The secondary school I went to didn't have a sixth form - so after taking your GCSE exams, you had to make a choice between moving to the sixth form at Burford - the pretend grammar school a few miles away, or West Oxforshire Technical College - a few miles in the other direction. During the summer before I went there, it's name to West Oxfordshire College. Everybody still called it "Witney Tech" though.

My first visit to Witney Tech had been during the summer holidays. I went one evening with my Dad, and met Mr Perry - an officious looking bear of a man. He looked like the sort of person you wouldn't cross - with straight white hair sprouting from his head at odd angles, and horn rimmed glasses.

I don't recall what we talked about, but a few weeks later a letter arrived through the post, confirming my place on courses for Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. For some reason I didn't pick art, and I'm still not sure why.

Getting to college each day meant catching a bus from the middle of town - which in turn meant congregating at the bus stop with numerous other students. After years of wearing school uniform, suddenly we could wear whatever we chose to - some took full advantage of this. You might have thought the more fashionable boys were heading to a Simple Minds concert, and the girls not so much to see Madonna, but to be her.

The college bus was a dilapidated double-decker. I never went upstairs - that was almost exclusively the domain of the popular kids, and I was by no means popular. I wasn't without friends though - a few of my old school friends also found themselves on the same courses as me, and over time a circle of sorts formed.

Simon was a staunch socialist - the son of a socialist that had run in local elections for years. During our secondary school years, he would always be out canvassing for his Dad - going door to door, delivering leaflets, and so on. He was tall, and wiry in build - all elbows and knees, and had a mop of straight dark hair. His reading glasses dominated his face, making him appear very serious. We shared the same idiotic sense of humor, and both harbored ideas of writing stories, or plays at some point in our life.

Kevin had only been a distant friend at school, but grew into one of my closest at college. He was tall, thin, and remarkably quiet most of the time. We would often sit in the library at college and pretend to read.

Michael - he of supernatural coding ability fame from secondary school - would arrive at the bus stop clutching a can of diet coke, and invariably try to appear far more cool than he really was. I bumped into him in a video store years later, and he was STILL pretending to be somebody he was not.

I remember standing at the bus stop with Simon, Michael, and Kevin, talking about the most recent episodes of Quantum Leap. That makes me feel incredibly old.

The bus journey to college only took a few minutes most days. I remember a few people buying motorbikes, and we would often see them en-route. One particular boy, that obviously imagined his 50cc scooter was far more powerful than it actually was, tried to overtake the college bus one day - I remember seeing his head slowly pass by the bus windows, as he held the throttle wide open. The bus driver obviously saw this going on (it was a quiet road), and sped up just a little bit - enough to make the boy's head go slowly back down the bus - this time being laughed at and jeered by everybody on-board. I don't even want to imagine what he saw in the back window of the bus after pulling back in behind it.

I can also remember a time we left for college, and a boy narrowly missed the bus - running to the bus stop as the doors closed, and we pulled away. I don't think I have ever seen anybody quite so angry - he ran alongside the doors, thumping on them, and screaming obscenities. We could pretty much guess every word coming from his mouth - and most of them began with F.

The bus would drop us off in a car-park opposite the main college buildings - leading to a lemming-like exodus of students trying to cross the road every few minutes on a morning. In the council's infinite wisdom, the nearest road crossing was several hundred yards away.

Although the college had a vast student common room, I very rarely set foot in it - I tended to congregate with a small number of other students on the same courses as me in a building called "G-Block". In the foyer of G-Block there were a number of easy chairs and low tables - and somehow we made it our home. I don't think we consciously set out to either - it just sort of happened. Across the way from the chairs there was a staff room, and a receptionist for the building sitting at a hatch. You could wander up and ask for paper - plain, narrow, or wide ruled - and would be given about an inch of paper to put in your work binders for free - without question. I thought this was marvelous.

My computer science and mathematics classes were all in G-Block - on different floors of the building. I seem to remember maths was on the second floor, and computer science on the third. The ground floor was dominated by engineering - with the classrooms setup for pneumatics, electrical experiments, and such like.

I think I've written about the computer science teacher elsewhere. His name was Jeremy Jackson - a small man - who always dressed in a suit, but had a huge mop of dark hair, and a black beard. His fringe would be pulled across his forehead, often hanging over his glasses. He walked with a limp - perhaps the result of polio as a child - we never asked him, and he never told us. We would wait outside the door of the computer science class for him to arrive, and watch as he limped along the corridor towards us. He stood or sat at the front of the classroom, and wrote notes onto a reel of transparency on an overhead projector. I thought this a genius idea - throughout the year the roll would slowly fill with everything he had written, drawn, or whatever else - and it meant he could roll it backwards to re-cap something from a previous lesson.

We all knew that Mr Jackson could be distracted by talking about Star Trek, or about his own days at university. I remember one particular story about the people he was sharing a house with dying their cornflakes to prevent thieving.

Who were "we" though? Let's see how many of the computer science class I can remember.

There was me, obviously. Graham, who did archery at weekends, Stephan, who played drums, Andrew, the son of a farmer, Michael, the gifted genius I had been at school with, Sarah, one of the prettiest girls I think I ever knew (and that I stumbled over talking to every time I had to), Tony (that had been in the year ahead of me at school), and Simon, a somewhat aloof, but likeable kid that I would learn to keep well away from.

Simon did nothing directly awful, or nasty - he was likeable, charming even. He was almost the most manipulative person I had ever met at that point in my life - only I had never met anybody like him before, so I didn't see it at all.

The computer classes were mostly lectures - listening to Mr Jackson talk, and writing lots of notes. Occasionally we had programming assignments, and used the computers on the desks (we each had a computer!) to write and test code. We learned a programming language called Pascal. Coming from a background hacking bits of code together in BASIC, I was horrified when told that there was not "GOTO" command in Pascal.

"and even if there was, you would be banned from using it"

If you have no background in software development, you will have no idea what I'm talking about. Most programming languages have methods of jumping across the code, from one point to another - for example, if something happens in the code, or if a condition is met, go to this part of the code next - that sort of thing. In BASIC you can use GOTO to skip to any part of a program - imagine the mess you can get into with lots of GOTO commands. Needless to say we learned all about properly structured programming methods, where you DON'T get into a gigantic mess.

I found computer science pretty easy. My exam project was kept by the college, and used as an example for future years - not because it was stunningly brilliant it turns out, but because it was pretty good, but could have been better. I remember writing the documentation for the program (an order processing system for the family business) in one week of mayhem on a PC I borrowed from my Aunt. I typed up 70 pages in about three days, and damaged the nerves in my finger tips in the process. 

On the middle floor I sat in Richard Goddard's mathematics class. I think it's fair to say that Mr Goddard turned me around in terms of mathematics. Not just me. He turned the entire class around. He was a wonderfully gifted teacher, and must have been horrified at the holes in our mathematical knowledge during the first few math lessons - so much so that he went back to basics, and spent the first few weeks teaching us math from scratch again.

The "us" were myself, Tony (again), Kevin (from the bus), Simon, and Andrew from the computer class, Bob - a mysterious guy that seemed to be something of a math prodigy, James, who dressed like a computer game joystick, Kate, who was gorgeous and that Simon had a monumental crush on, Tina, who had a mass of curly hair, and an endless supply of denim jackets, and Neil, who appeared to have just come from a skateboard or BMX park most days.

Somehow - by hook, or by crook - Mr Goddard got me through the math exams in one piece. I've often thought about finding him again - to thank him. I'm not sure how I might go about it though.

While most of my memories of college are good, there are some negative ones too. 

In my first year I took Economics - taught on the far side of the campus by a woman called Sue Grant. She was kind of a throwback to the 1970s in the style of clothes she wore, and was probably a perfectly good teacher - but I had no real interest in economics, and probably put as little effort in as humanly possible. After a year of struggling, I dropped the subject, and remember a very uncomfortable meeting with her, where she sat at her desk and said nothing for quite some time. "Failing" at economics meant I would be at college for an extra year, but I didn't really see a problem with that.

My one abiding memory of Sue was a story she told about teaching in a prison at some point during her career, and the lights failing in the classroom, followed by a huge amount of commotion around her. It turned out several of the prisoners were sex offenders - one of them had tried to reach her in the darkness, and several others had essentially kicked the crap out of them before the lights came back up.

The bonus to dropping Economics was I finally got to do art. I had tried the previous year, after realising my mistake, but the class was already full. I remember walking in and seeing all the students I had been at school with, who pointed with wide eyes, and told their new friends that I was good. So yes - FINALLY I was going to do art.

The art teacher was called Jane Pollard. She had long dark hair, was curvy (I was going to write voluptuous, but it seems wrong to write that about a teacher), and wore jeans with boots most of the time. She was a wonderful artist, and leaned on me pretty hard. She remembered me from the year before, and knew I might have some potential. She was shocked when I left college to get a job working with computers - I think she already had my future mapped out doing a degree in fine art somewhere.

Jane worked hand in hand with a pottery teacher called Dave Sutcliffe. He was barking mad, but also a mine of information about making and glazing pots, and one of the few teachers I knew that had a background in industry - he had worked at a pottery for years before becoming a teacher. He also taught photography, which I took as a filler subject during my final year.

The art class was kind of like a refuge from the rest of the college. I was a year older than many of the other students, and consequently a little bit more mature. It made a huge difference. I had little or no patience for the younger students that often messed around, and shut off when they began talking about drunken nights out. Art was the one subject I didn't really have to try at though - I could just do it. In the same way I had been singled out at school though, the same thing happened at college to an extent. A lot of my work ended up on the walls of the art room - particularly my drawings of people.

I think I became fascinated with drawing people because they were so much more difficult than anything else. I've always held the opinion that people only paint landscapes because they can't paint people. A tree is still a tree if you get it wrong - if you get a face or body wrong, it either looks hideously deformed, or nothing like the subject.

During my final year of college - my third year - I took filler subjects to help fill the days - Photography, Travel &amp; Tourism, and Accounting. I have no idea why on earth I took the final two - probably because I thought they might be easy. Can you ever imagine me working as a travel guide? I thought not.

Photography was taught by the pottery teacher, and is interesting now perhaps because only a few years later digital cameras replaced everything I had been taught. I'm one of the last generations that learned how to operate a film SLR camera properly, and to process film. We learned about silver halides that recorded light, and various other noxious chemicals that printed and fixed photographic paper. I still have a box-file somewhere in the attic filled with photos from that course.

Travel and Tourism was taught by a wonderful teacher called Ramona Riley. It became obvious pretty quickly that we were all there to fill out timetable - the unlikely group comprised of me, a Chinese boy from the family that owned the local takeaway, a massive fan of Billy Idol that bleached his hair, and wore studded jackets, and a couple of younger girls. The course was hardly taxing - I vaguely remember a few written assignments along the way - one about Victoria Falls as a tourist destination. Of course in the real world nobody has been to Victoria Falls for the last decade because of the troubles that have ravaged Zimbabwe.

Accounting was another filler subject. I joined the course late (I don't recall why), and learned how to do book-keeping on paper. It always struck me as slightly strange given that computers were now used exclusively to keep accounts, we were taught how to write it all by hand, as somebody might have a hundred years previously. I passed the course, but only just. I still don't really know how I passed, because I almost go in trouble for missing 50% of Friday lessons for an entire term.

So there you go - my time at West Oxfordshire College, distilled into a few paragraphs. No doubt I will add to the recollections as they occur to me, but this covers the bones of the story.

            <Title>Arriving at my First Job</Title>
            <Synopsis>Memories of working at ABS. The job, the characters, the nights out, the christmas parties. Lots of stories. The fact that I still miss it, 20 years later.</Synopsis>
            <Text>I remember the first day of my “proper” job like it was yesterday.

It was a Monday in May, 1995. I got up early, had a shower, a shave, and put on smart clothes. I would not be returning to the family business ever again. I would never have to file invoices and statements ever again. Never process the payroll ever again. Never wake up to my Dad shouting up the stairs to give me a lift. It was on me now.

After an informal chat with the managing director a few weeks previously, I had been given a three month probationary period, and a very small salary indeed. I didn’t really care though - I was finally doing what I wanted - nerding out with computers all day - and to be honest I would have done it for free at that point in my life.

Whenever I left the house for work I would walk away from the house doing a strange sort of hail-mary - checking pockets for wallet, keys, and mobile phone. My brother thought it was hilarious that I had a mobile phone - it had been bought on an impulse while shopping in Oxford one weekend. I had very few outgoings, so could afford it - I still lived with my parents, and only had to pay them a small amount each week from my pay packet - they called it “keep”.

I used a briefcase for the first few days in the new job - bought through a stamp scheme at the local petrol station. Inside the briefcase was a filofax - my first filofax - and I thought myself tremendously important in having one. In the days before starting work I had filled out the calendar, contacts, and various notes pages with all manner of rubbish - just to make it look like I used it. In truth I had very few places to be, things to do, or people to call. When I see pictures of peoples bullet journals these days, they make me smile because I can see straight through them.

I used to get the bus to work. I remember standing at the bus-stop under the “Iron Bridge” a little way from our house - the bridge of so many childhood bicycle accidents. To a six year old the bridge was impressively enormous - the kind of thing Evil Kinevil would have used in one of his tremendous stunts. I remember standing on the paving stones of the bus stop, and figuring out that my feet were almost the same length as the paving stones were wide - it’s amazing the things you notice when you have nothing else to do. I also remember an RAF officer that would regularly cycle past - he always looked gaunt, wind-swept, and had an impressive grey moustache.

The busses that ran between Carterton and Witney were about two thirds the size of a coach, and ran every twenty minutes or so during mornings and evenings. They were subsidised, meaning the ticket were ridiculously cheap, and I always thought it strange that more people didn’t use them. The morning bus I usually caught had the same people on it almost every day - people doing the same as me - commuting to work. There was a neat older gentleman that always wore a grey suit, was balding with slicked back hair, and wore large wire-rimmed glasses. I suspected he was something to do with the police, given how neat and tidy he always was. He typically sat next to a lady in her 60s with huge reading glasses shaped like a butterfly.

On the return journey there would often be a pretty girl that got off at the same stop as me. In the several years that we shared the journey I desperately wanted to say hello to her, but never said a word beyond offering to let her out of her seat before me. People often talk about “sliding doors” moments in your life, and I sometimes wonder what would have happened if we had become friends on the bus, and shared the journey home from work together each day. The only time I ever interracted with her was when some idiots got on the bus one evening (they had obviously been in the pub), and were trying to chat her up all the way home - when we got to our stop, I tried to look as big and confident as I could, reached out a hand, and said “I think this is our stop?” - I’ll never forget the beaming smile, or the exhale and “THANKYOU!” when the bus doors closed behind us. We at least progressed to smiles after that.

I used to be SO shy.

The bus went through Brize Norton and Curbridge en-route to Witney. All I really knew about Curbridge was a comment from my Uncle that moved to America - that he had once been out with a girl from Curbridge, and he had been a horrible person. Quite how he decided that the entire village was populated by horrible people on the strength of one girl is something of a mystery. I remember us all laughing at his story, and him doubling down - ranting about the village for quite some time. I think he may have been drinking.

After arriving in the centre of Witney, my route took me across the church green, past Harry Enfield’s house (a television celebrity - everybody said he lived there, but nobody knew exactly where), through the grounds of the really quite impressive St Mary’s church, and along a tree line path through a park called “The Leas” - the site of a funfair called “Witney Feast” each year.

Childhood memories of Witney Feast abound. I think it was begun in the middle-ages as a hog roast run by the local nobility for the peasants - but in the modern era had become a vast, noisy, brightly lit invasion of hydraulics, bumber cars, screaming, candyfloss, toffee apples, and fairground families. The yearly arrival of Witney Feast was greeted in the same vein as Christmas by children, and probably dreaded by parents.

For the rest of the year, the Leas stood empty - a quiet place with towering oak trees that you could sit under at lunchtime in the summer, and get away from the office. I know, because I did - usually with Debbie from reception.

After leaving the Leas and following road-signs through a small industrial the other side of the road that skirted the Leas, I found myself climbing a set of stairs, and stepping into a smart, busy office populated with people wearing office clothes - something of a novelty after so long spent either as a student, or on the shop-floor of a working quarry. A smiling lady in her mid-40s with perfect hair stood up from her desk, shook my hand, and said “You must be Jonathan!”

I was told to wait in a glass walled area at the end of the office that looked suspiciously like it was made from pieces of a conservatory. While nervously waiting, I watched the office full of strangers going about their morning - using the copier machine, stopping by each other’s desks to chat, typing things into their computers, and leaning back in chairs with phone handsets clasped to their ears. After a minute or two I recognise the boss - the man I had met a few weeks earlier. He’s being interrupted every few steps by questions from the staff around him.

“Good morning! Good to see you! If you come with me, I’ll show you to your desk - your computer arrived on Friday - I’ll give you some time to get yourself sorted out, and then  we could perhaps have a get-together mid-morning to meet everybody, and find out what you can get started on.”

We wandered past several desks, and I was conscious of being watched. I shook hands with people, smiled, greeted people politely, and told them I would struggle with their names.

In the far corner of the office I find an empty desk, surrounded by software boxes and new hardware. After putting my briefcase down, and sitting in the new office chair, the main sitting directly in front of me spins round in his chair, smiling.

“Don’t you take any notice of what these lots say about you, young John - you look like a fine young man to me”.

He then bursts into a song about a boy standing on a burning aircraft carrier deck with sticks of explosives in his pockets. His name was David Lines, and he became a wonderful friend, mentor, and conspirator in endless stories throughout my years working with him. I’ll save those stories for another day though. There are many.

Laughing politely at his hand-grenade comment, I busy myself with unpacking the new toys on the desk. Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and Microsoft Access 2. I press the power button on the beige box tucked under the desk, and the computer chirps into life - filling the new monitor screen with jibberish.

Bloody hell fire.

They bought me a Pentium. The first pentium I, or anybody I knew had ever seen. It was the most powerful computer in the entire company, and it was mine.

I remember a very distinct thought going through my head for a few seconds - “please don’t let me fuck this up”.</Text>

            <Title>Working for the Family Business</Title>
            <Synopsis>Working at the family business in the summers - describe the job, and the odd collection of characters. Jim on the forklift, Brian the lunatic, Alan the lazy cousin, Pete the droll foreman, Harry the story teller, and so on.</Synopsis>
            <Text>When you work in a dead end job for long enough, you enter a strangely static state. You turn up each day, get the bare minimum of work done, and trudge home. Rinse, and repeat, day after day, week after week, month after month. Your mind becomes junctified – any concept of escape or change becomes “something that happens to other people” – not that it occurs to you at the time, because your mind is more occupied with making another cup of tea or coffee.

Such was the situation I found myself in during the early months of 1995. I had left college two years previously to work for the family business “for a few months”. After studying computer science, art and mathematics at college, I found myself doing all the jobs around the office that nobody else wanted to do – and had no choice but to do them – I was the very bottom of the food chain.

Why invoices cannot be stored in invoice number order (the order they come off a tractor feed printer) is a mystery to me, and always will be. I suspect the job of re-sorting and filing them into alphabetic order by customer or supplier was invented as a sadist punishment just for me. Something to occupy a few hours out of each and every day.

Filing invoices was marginally better than doing the wages run, which for a manufacturing company consisted of filling in identical figures for three quarters of the workforce – all of which carefully made sure they didn’t earn too much. The economy of the time dictated that you could claim all manner of benefits as long as you didn’t earn above a specific amount. This turned the brainless majority on the factory floor into chartered accountants and analysts. They never put in too much effort ever again.

The workforce of most manufacturing companies tends to read like the crew of an average pirate ship just out of Neverland. Although payslips had real staff names on, co-workers only knew each other by their variously invented nicknames. Birdie, Fatbloke, Budgie, Noddy – the list went on. Being the son of a director, and working in the office most of the time, I was of course treated wonderfully to my face, and no doubt labelled “wank face” or some other such impressive name to which I was supposedly unaware.

At various times during the summer while factory floor staff were on holiday, I would take somebody’s place in the production line. This invariably caused consternation from the foreman who would quietly take you to one side and explain that you were working too fast – making the regular workers look bad (due to their benefit induced work rate). This all happened of course due to the boring nature of the various jobs. How best to keep sane when taking bricks off a machine and stacking them on palettes ? Try to break records. Time for 1 palette – 10 square yards of bricks, if you’re interested. Number of palettes in an hour. In a day.

While working on production-line machinery you come into contact with one of the wonders of the workplace – the forklift truck driver. While we may think of Formula One, or Rally drivers as the pinnical of driving skill, this is of course rubbish. At least in their own mind, Forklift drivers are the fastest, bravest drivers to ever walk the earth – and they like to display their talents at every opportunity possible. Unfortunately they also lack a good deal of the common sense that your average 5 year old seems to develop naturally.

I watched one driver with particular interest one afternoon – let’s call him Kevin – his real name, as it happens. His entire vocabulary consisted of phrases lifted from one comedy television show called “Bottom”. Trying to communicate with him in terms of anything outside of the script of the show was particularly difficult, so you just didn’t bother. Kevin had not learned that the forklift blades were longer than the palettes he was carrying. While stacking palettes of cement bags against a brick wall one day, he carefully punched letterbox sized holes in the brickwork at regular intervals both vertically and horizontally along the entire wall. When his boss found out (a particularly wankerish director, who may or may not appear in this memoir), his disbelief was such that he didn’t know how to punish him – so didn’t.

To combat the enviable skills of the forklift drivers, one of the more dangerous high speed bends in the track / workplace was re-designed by the track owners / directors. One of the bigger buildings had been the scene of a pretty spectacular head-on collision between two of the championship contenders, punting one of them through the wall of the building. A week later the wall had been rebuilt, and massive iron railings bolted to the wall and the floor. The presence of safety features in the track switched off any fear in the leading driver’s mind, which unfortunately resulted in the next spinning protagonist taking out the new railing, along with the entire section of building it was bolted to.

Trying to communicate with forklift drivers was best done in writing. Living within the private world of their cab, they seemed to develop a unique language – comprised of a strange high pitch accent, and unintelligable temper. You had the sense you were hearing a stream of expletives, but weren’t exactly sure. You might occasionally make out the odd work – “kinkyboots”, or something similar.

The very important business of the family business was quarrying stone to sell on as various products for the construction industry. Explaining the concept of the work to anybody uninformed could be particularly difficult. In order to make natural stone, you start out by blowing the crap out of a rock face. You then turn what you blew to crap into dust by grinding it to oblivion. The then add cement, water, and a couple of chemicals, and pump it into another machine that squashes holy hell out of the mixture. The resulting lego bricks are then left out to harden. Later still, the blocks are fed into huge machines that snap them into brick shapes – the bricks we see houses built from.

Yet more processes are performed on some of the bricks in order to make them look more like the stone you started with. One of the more humorous was “tumbling” – tipping the bricks into a huge inclined, rotating tube so they bash into one another and end up looking much older than they really are. Another finishing technique chopped the top and bottom from the face of every brick – a process performed manually, and roughly akin in skill level to “ding it goes up”, “ding it goes down”. Such work requires a very specific kind of person.

Working in the office often exposed you to the great unwashed masses who drove in from the road looking for a few rocks for their rockery. Trying to explain what happens to stone that has been blown from a rockface when rain hits it was particularly frustrating – and usually resulted in the same people returning after the first heavy rain to complain that their wonderfully twee rockery had dissolved before their eyes.

While busily filiing paperwork, an occaisional moment of interest happened when a heavy goods vehicle pulled in from the passing road to use the weigh bridge. For the years I worked there, I automatically drew the short straw in terms of trudging over to weigh the various loads. I learned something ratherimportant for later life during those brief interactions though – heavy goods vehicle drivers are the best at swearing in the known universe, and they are proud of it. I expressed genuine admiration of their ability to put so many expletives into a single sentence, and it still somehow make sense. They swore, cursed and ranted with the ease and artistry of an operatic tenor. When confronted with any form of obstacle, the colourful stream of dissatisfaction burst forth like a firehose.

This tour of the various facets of the dead end job I found myself in is perhaps important in terms of establishing a base. A dark place from which a ray of light might penetrate, and finally illuminate a world outside of the one I inhabited. The messenger from that world turned out to be the company acccountant.

Describing the accountant as “the messenger from another world” is perhaps fortuitous. Accountants are generally thought of as boring – people who keep their posessons in alphabetical order. People who like things to make sense. The family business somehow ended up with an accountant who promoted the idea of past lives, aliens, spirit guides, and little folk to anybody who might listen – which was quite a shock given his stereotypically “accountant” appearance. Sensible pinstripe shirt. Glasses. Moustache. Sensible car. Sensible shoes. Belief in, quite frankly, bloody strange ideas… Hmmm…

Given my open view of the world at the time, and endless tales sucked from the early internet and bulletin boards of secret documents, little grey men, zeta reticulans, and craft powered by exotic elements, we got on famously. While he tried to make me believe in little invisible people who accompany me along my way each day, I tried to open his eyes to the global conspiracy surrounding us all – that an alien invasion was imminent – the bulletin boards said so, and stuff on the bulletin boards was always the truth.

(in reality, the bulletin board systems that predated mass internet take-up were filled with lonely people who never left their houses – purporting to be be far more socially aware than they really were. Hidden behind impressive sounding pseudonyms, authorities on official government leaked documents such as “MJ12”, “Project Red Book”, and “The Robertson Panel” had names such as “Hax0r”, “L33tD00d”, and “DrWH0”).

So. A background has been established. A place within which I often found myself sitting on rainy afternoons, putting bits of paper into folders, while looking forward to the highlight of making everybody another cup of tea (usually asked for by one of the directors, who were busily completing their thousandth game of solitaire on the office computer that day).

The phone rang, and I answered it.

“Hi Jonathan, it’s Neil” (the accountant)

“Hi, the Aliens haven’t abducted you yet then?”

“(polite laughter) Nope. Listen. I’ve got a question. How about you getting a real job?”

“Eh?” (my mind starts to lurch in the same manner as you might if just learning that the world is in fact round, and not flat).

“I do the accounts for a company in Witney who are expanding, and they need somebody who knows about computers, databases, and such like to help them grow. Interested ?”

“Yes!” (escape! a route of escape! the thought of no more filing was now filling my head very quickly indeed)

“Okay – I’ve arranged for you to come and have an informal chat with the managing director next tuesday – okay?”

And so it was that the opportunity presented itself to change the course of my life – delivered by a spiritualist accountant over the telephone to a moron stuck in a dead end job from which he considered no escape. An opportunity to start a career that should perhaps have begun two years previously, but had for various reasons (including laziness, easiness, and a terminal leaning towards procrastination) never happened.

This next few years tell the story of a small company learning to grow, the people that made it happen, drunken nights out, bizarre characters, ridiculous situations, and of visits to the local nightclub that always seemed like a good idea at the time.

You’ve not lived until you’ve shouted “My friend doesn’t like you” to a weird looking chap at a pub, only to discover that the 7ft tall fat hairy biker the other side of the bar got your joke and didn’t think it was very funny at all.</Text>

</Synopsis>
            <Text>When I say that the internet had “arrived”, that’s obviously not entirely true. The Internet had been in development since the 1960s - first through Arpanet (the Advanced Research Projects Network) used by the US military, and then through the work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn at BBN to improve it.

You see - the first version of what we now call “The Internet” was designed rather badly. Each computer had to be wired directly to each other computer on the network. Also, each computer ran different software, and interfaced with other computers in different ways - so to get two computers to talk to each other, you had to develop bespoke software to translate in either direction. Add to that the idiocy of adding more computers to the network, along with wires to all the other computers, and methods of communication between them all, and you can see the problem.

Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn invented “TCP/IP”, and “Packet Switching”. They are still used today, and describe a standard way through which any number of computers wired to the same network can communicate with each other - picking and choosing which information being sent across the network is for them, and sending that information as lots of tiny bits (packets), which can be re-compiled at the destination.

The beauty of packet switching came in the idea that computers in the middle of the spiders-web of interconnected machines could be knocked out, and the network would still work - finding new routes for packets around the problem areas. You can see straight away why this might have been developed - the threat of nuclear war - and you can also see that once you build the network, you can’t really switch it off - because it will survive your attempts.

Except you could. And it happened. By accident.

In the early days of the internet, before the World Wide Web had really taken off, it became obvious that it should be easier to identify computers on the network than by their “address” on the network - a group of integers split by periods (you’ve probably seen these numbers - IP addresses - the internet still works the same way). The idea of “domain names” was thought up - names that represented the numbers - such as “harvard.edu”, or “yahoo.com”. The list of names correlating to addresses obviously needed to be copied to each server - so when a request was made of a given computer system by it’s name, the system would know that a given name meant a given IP address. Rather than have a single computer giving out the addresses, it was thought best that each of the big computer systems on the network should have their own copy, and replicate changes from the master database. The fault in this system? The master database.

The computer at the centre of the domain name system died one day, and over the next few hours the internet stopped working for the millions of people using it around the world. Needless to say it was eventually fixed - but yeah - proves even the geniuses that built the internet were fallible.

Sorry for the history lesson.

So - the internet had been around for a while, in educational institutions, and government facilities, but had not really happened outside of that.

What *had* happened was a madcap priesthood of crazy people running their own systems via the telephone network. They were called Bulletin Boards - and you needed a modem to access them.

Guess who bought a modem.

I was at PC World with my Dad buying printer ink and paper. PC World had opened a few months earlier, and was something of a novelty - a one-stop-shop where you could buy anything from a box of paper, to a mouse, or even a desktop computer.

In the months previously I had been reading computer magazines, and had seen numerous adverts for an online service called “Compuserve” that promised to connect you with the world. The advert showed a distant house in the middle of nowhere, with one light on, and some blurb about never being alone, no matter how remote you might be. I was sold.

We bought a V32bis modem - the meaning of the code is now lost in the sands of time - I think it means the modem would communicate on the V-Modem protocol with other computers, at a rate of 32,000 bits a second. The various protocols bestowed different error correction, and compression powers on the modem - the likelihood that data would be transmitted correctly.

The modem sat between the computer, and the telephone line in your house, using a splitter cable. While you were connected to the internet, you were essentially making a call to the “Internet Service Provider”, who would then connect you to the internet. These days the modem in your house essentially acts as both the modem, AND the gateway - back then, the ISP was the gateway. Well - except if you connected to a Bulletin Board system.

Bulletin Board systems were perhaps the earliest form of internet community for the masses - you could connect to a server, and browse conversations on any number of subjects, and pitch into them yourselves. While some bulletin boards were self contained, others acted as a bridge between you, and a far bigger community message board system called Usenet. We now know usenet as “newsgroups” - I’m not really sure why.

I fell in love with usenet immediately. I had read no end of conspiracy theory books during my teenage years, and knew that all the best information (or misinformation, it turns out) was being published to usenet - to groups such as alt.ufo. After watching endless episodes of The X-Files, and forming an unexplainable attraction to Gillian Anderson, hoardes of people too to Usenet to share anything they thought they knew, and even found ways of transferring photos through plain text. It was called UUEncoding, and proved that porn will ALWAYS find a way.

The one problem with bulletin board systems is that you had to be connected to them in order to read, write, and reply to messages. Sure, there were fancy software applications called “Off Line Readers” that made that process more efficient, but it was still a largely disconnected, overtly technical, and user unfriendly world.

The general public would never have taken to the online world in the numbers they did without the help of two companies - Compuserve, and America Online. They each created their own bulletin board system, but polished it to within an inch of it’s life, and dumbed everything down.

The systems aped bulletin boards, and introduced private messaging (email with the wider internet was still not a thing - if you were connected to Compuserve, you could only message fellow users of Compuserve, for example).

I had accounts at both Compuserve, and America Online over the next year or so. As has often happened through history, the massively inferior product won out - America Online, or AOL as it came to be known flooded the world with CDs containing the software installer for their system. Every magazine had an AOL CD on the cover, and they were even sent through the post. Millions upon millions of them.

If you look around in gardens, and allotments, you still see AOL CDs from time to time - made into bird scarers, hanging from pieces of string.

I miss Compuserve. I still remember my ID number (you had an ID number - not a username) - mine was 100333,3457. I’ve often wondered if there was a structure to the user ID numbers - if the various parts of the number meant anything at all. Of all of the various interest groups and clubs available at Compuserve, the Writers Forum still stands out in my memory. I made my first real online friendships with strangers there, and took part in numerous writing exercises.

The Compuserve advert was actually true - no matter who you were, or where you were, you could connect and find your tribe.

I can remember the day a new icon appeared in both the Compuserve, and AOL interfaces. It looked like a picture of a globe, and launched a second piece of software called “NCSA Mosaic”. Mosaic opened to a blank screen, with a text box above, that you could enter “addresses” into.

It was 1993, and it was the World Wide Web.

A guy called Tim Berners Lee at the CERN project in Switzerland had become frustrated that even though the various computer systems were not connected to each other through the “internet”, there was still no easy way of publishing notes and research for others to see - so he set about inventing it.

It’s easy to say now that the world wide web changed everything - but when it first appeared it was slow, buggy, and the software tended to crash a lot. Magazines wrote at length about it’s importance, and it’s growing popularity - emphasising its open, decentralised nature. Where Compuserve forums could only be visited by Compuserve members, and AOL forums could only be visited by AOL members, the World Wide Web could be used by everybody.

It came as no surprise, decades later, when Tim Berners Lee appeared at the opening of the London Olympic Games, and keyed into a NeXT workstation “This is for everybody”.

            <Synopsis>Memories of the first computer I ever used in anger - the MSX.</Synopsis>
            <Text>A few months after the Alphatronic debacle, I tagged along with my Dad to visit the local television rental shop. We had rented our television for years - most people did. Or rather, most people we knew did. In the shop we were shown an apparently amazing new thing called a lazer disc player, along with various televisions. This was back in the era of cathods-ray-tube televisions that weight about the same as a small car. It's quite sad that children will never know the struggle of watching a portable television while on-holiday, with it wired up to a car battery, Dad holding the aerial in the air to get a good signal, and the screen slowly diminishing in size as the battery charge depletes.

Where was I. Oh yes - the television rental shop. On this particular visit, the shop also had a display of "home computers". They all seemed to be made by Sharp, and were mightily impressive - much smaller than the computer we had recently destroyed, and seemingly capable of doing anything if you believed the promotional pamphlet. The glossy brochure kicked around at home for months - right up until Christmas in fact.

When I opened my Christmas presents that year though, I didn't find one of the computers we had looked at. Oh no. I found a "Sony HitBit". An MSX. Although it's easy to criticise now, it was actually a really smart move. While Commodore, Sinclair, and Atari all made incompatible computers, the Japanese companies had all agreed to make compatible systems - Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba, Goldstar, and Yamaha all made MSX computers that ran the same software. There was only one problem - everybody carried on buying Commodore, Sinclair, and Atari computers.

This resulted in the video game shelves of the local toy store being stacked with row upon row of games - hundreds of games - for every home computer system, and the MSX being relegated to the bottom row, with perhaps five or six to choose from - one or two of which would be affordable on a pocket-money budget.

I wonder how many hours I spent deliberating over a £1.99 video game on cassette tape that would ultimately turn out to be shit, and forgotten before lunchtime on a Saturday ?

Cassette tapes! Later generations really haven't lived, have they. If you grew up using home computers during the mid-eighties, you knew all about the hell of cassette tapes. Not only did you need to plug a tape recorder into your computer, you also needed to set the volume exactly right for every single tape. Upon pressing play, and keying the correct commands into the computer, a high pitch squeal would ring out across the room before the the computer and tape recorder began communicating in pure noise with each other. That's what it sounded like, anyway. Even if you got everything right, and held high hopes of playing your game in a few minutes time (because loading a few kilobytes took entire minutes), you might still face failure at any point. I think perhaps the most heart wrenching episodes were when the tape reached it's end, and the video game still looked like it was loading - and you hadn't noticed for quite some time.

Luckily the MSX had something that many other home computers didn't at that time - a cartridge slot. Yes, the old Atari 2600 had cartridges, but home computers didn't tend to have them. I was lucky enough to get a cartridge based game that first Christmas too - "Yee Arr Kung Foo". No racial stereotypes going on there then! It turns out Konami - one of the most famous producers of coin operated arcade machines - had singed on to create games for the MSX range of computers, and were busy porting a lot of their back-catalog to the MSX. Imagine that - first party ports of arcade machines. Although we only ever owned one or two of them, their arrival turned out house into the must-visit destination for those in-the-know.

It's funny though - although we had some games for the computer that first Christmas, we didn't really play them. It snowed that year - so like any other normal kids, we disregarded all of the presents our parents had scrimped and saved to buy us, and ran around like lunatics outside, pelting snowballs at each other. This had an unintended consequence though - my Dad was left alone with the computer, and set about learning to program it.

Over the Christmas period, we would wander back into the house - walking snow with us, and being shouted at for it - and my Dad would invariably be hunched over the computer with the guide book next to him. The guide book that came with the Sony MSX had comic book characters sprinkled throughout, to help explain the concepts behind programming. Looking back now, they were Chibi Manga cartoons, but this was at least twenty years before ìMangaî became a thing.

Now and again my Dad would encourage us to sit and watch the results of his endeavors. I still remember him typing ìRUNî, and watching a low resolution facsimile of the Olympic rings draw onto the screen.

ìWhat does it do?î

ìThatís itî

ìOh.î

I guess the eleven year old version of me was pretty difficult to impress. Over the next few days he slowly added to his program - it asked your name, your age, your favourite colour, and so on - and then made pithy comments about the information you had entered. Mum didnít think it was very funny when she discovered the program had been fixed to recognise her name, and be purposely rude.

I suppose in some ways I have my Dad to thank for everything that followed. He was the one that showed me that a computer could be programmed - that the games you might buy off the shelf in the toy shop had been written by somebody no better than you or me - just a little (or a lot) more experienced, and with a lot more time and determination on their hands. I didnít start writing any programs of note - I never would on the MSX, but it sowed a seed that would come to fruition some five years later.

For several years, the MSX was our family computer. My Dad obsessed over a game called "Les Flics" that could most accurately be described as a collection of coloured blobs that you could move around the screen with the joystick, that would make noises, and the screen flash from time to time. The box artwork told another story - you were a bank robber, and you were stealing things from various buildings, with the police in hot pursuit. A lot of imagination was required in the early days of computer games.

Back in the early 1980s, computer magazines were a huge business - especially if you owned a less popular machine. We would typically get one or two magazines a month, and I would read them cover to cover. Some of the writers became unlikely rock stars among the nerd community at school - Julian Rignall, that wrote for Computer and Video Games comes to mind. At the time, he looked like he just walked off stage with Duran Duran - looking back now, he was probably just out of college, had too much hair gel, and was trying too hard. In the back pages of the magazines you would find adverts for shops selling all manner of computer accessories and games - and one of them leads to perhaps the most ridiculous story about the MSX.

During my childhood years, we invariably went on holiday to Cornwall, in the south west of England. During one such holiday in the early 1980s, the weather wasn't cooperating at all, which meant we "went out for the day", rather than go to the beach. Dad drove us on a magical mystery tour of towns and villages until we reached a small town called "Tavistock", that looked nice - even though it was raining cats and dogs. The town became our destination for the day purely because of an advert that regularly appeared at the back of computer magazines - for a shop called "Tavistock Hi-Fi", that stocked everything to do with MSX computers. If you were unlucky enough to own an MSX, it was kind of like Mecca, but without prayer mats.

After walking the various streets of the town in search of the famous shop, and getting increasingly wet from the non-stop rain, we had lunch in an oddly religious cafe - complete with creepy printouts of psalms on the walls, and a waitress with long hair and a huge gap in her front teeth. While Mum and Dad talked about whatever it is that parents talk about in cafes, I spied a newsagent across the road. The newsagent might have computer magazines. The magazines might have the advert in them. The advert would have the address written on it.

(It's worth pointing out that having the address would still require a map - this was thirty years before we all had all-knowing devices in our back pockets).

I ran across the road with Dad, found a magazine, and found the advert. There it was - Tavistock Hi-Fi! In Bedford. I asked Dad where Bedford was - 250 miles away. Bugger. We never did visit the "real" Tavistock Hi-Fi, and strangely enough we never went back to Tavistock in Cornwall either. Years later, my parents retired, and moved to Cornwall - and whenever we visit and pass road signs with Tavistock on them, I break into a smile.

            <Synopsis>Anything and everything I can remember about the Atari ST.</Synopsis>
            <Text>In most respects, Evesham is an unremarkable market town in Worcestershire (pronounced “Woostershire”, for the benefit of international readers). During my childhood we would often drive past on the way to the coast, and stop at one of the many farms with road-side stalls to buy vegetables, cookies, or even cups of tea.

In the mid to late 1980s, Evesham became rather remarkable in my little world though - because it had a better computer shop than I had seen anywhere I had ever seen. Admittedly, I had never seen many computer shops, but that’s beside the point. Let’s just agree that it was very, very good indeed - and that it sold Atari STs.

I can still remember standing in the shop on the day we bought the computer. While we waited for the shop assistant to go out to the back of the store and pick up the computer and software we had ordered, we looked around at the same model of computer on display, and the various video games available for it. An enterprising assistant realised what we were doing, and quietly wandered over to “help”.

He loaded a couple of video games for us to look at. One was a three dimensional game of pool, with balls hanging in mid-air - we had never seen anything like it before, and found ourselves staring goggle eyed at it for some time. Next he dug out a copy of a new game that had just arrived in the store in a large grey box. It was called “Flight Simulator 2”.

For the next five minutes we stood mouths agape as a pretend Cessna taxied onto the runway at Oakland International Airport, across the bay from San Francisco, rolled down the runway at full throttle, and took to the air. I looked at my Dad, and he looked at me. There was a problem. The Flight Simulator game cost several times more than the savings I had taken with me.

“Don’t tell your Mum”.

We bought the computer, a rather large and mysterious blue box containing a music application called “Steinberg Pro 24”, and a copy of Flight Simulator 2.

I spent the next several weeks flying pretend Cessnas and Learjets around pretend west coast America. I learned to take off, land, loop the loop, and crash in all sorts of inventive ways. I even started to learn how to use the various instruments in the plane to navigate from one airport to another.

Of course my grades at school plummeted. It was only natural. From the moment I got home, until the moment I went to bed, I sat in front of the computer. I wasn’t the only one either.

The blue box we also bought contained a program that essentially turned the computer into a recording studio mixing desk. We had no idea how it worked, or how to use it, but we had all sorts of fun recording and playing back tunes on the big music keyboard across the room, with wires precariously dangling between the keyboard, and the computer.

It was all going so well until Dad accidentally deleted everything on the floppy disk the music program was on.

Oops.

We received another copy through the post a week or so later, but it was perhaps a first (rather brutal) lesson in how computer’s really worked.

At school I became a minor celebrity for a few days. Very few other people had comparable computers. I enthused endlessly about the flight simulator game, and might have embellished reality a little in my descriptions of the lavish game world. Even thirty years on, I don’t think video games have quite matched my descriptions of that game to friends while we were supposed to be getting on with technical drawing assignments.

I’m not quite sure when I first saw a word processor. At around the same time the Atari ST arrived at home, we were also studying computers at school. The school had a random assortment of CPM compatible machines forced on them by the local education authority. One afternoon our “Computer Studies” lesson comprised mostly of working through tasks with an early version of Wordstar. I was paired with one of my best friends - a boy called Simon - and we rattled through the exercises in no time at all. We then did what any self respecting kids would do when sat in front of a glorified typewriter - we started writing a story.

Simon lost his temper with me when the story took a madcap turn half-way through the first sentence, and became progressively more ridiculous. I had stumbled upon something I liked doing. While writing in a book was a chore, typing a story into a computer seemed as easy as breathing.

A few weeks later I bought a magazine with a floppy disk stuck to the cover that had free software on it. Among the various freebies was a word processor.

Guess who stopped playing games, and started writing? I wish I still had copies of the utter rubbish I wrote back then. Sure, it would be cringe-worthy, embarrassing, and unimaginably awful, but it would also be charming, in a “so bad it might be good” way.

Then of course there was the printer. One Christmas a huge box arrived home with Dad with a printer in it. Apparently it was for my aunt, for Christmas. It was hidden upstairs, and we were under no circumstance to tell her anything about it.

Of COURSE it wasn’t for my aunt. It was one of the most successful swindles in Christmas history. It was for me. I spent that entire Christmas period printing all manner of rubbish. I didn’t really need to print any of it - but I could, so I did. It was a “dot matrix” printer. This would mean nothing to anybody that has been born in the last twenty years. When you talk to accountants about dot matrix printers, they come over all misty-eyed, and recall tails about ledger printouts on wide-carriage tractor-feed paper.

You see, dot matrix printers worked by hammering an ink filled ribbon against the paper with a print head that had a row of tiny pins in it. As it passed along the paper, the pins fired back and forth at tremendous speed, smashing the shapes of letters onto the page. As the print head performed this feat, the entire assembly made a curious mechanical screaming sound. A very annoying mechanical screaming sound, if you were not the person printing something out.

Along with the printer, I also received a piece of software called a “database”. I had no idea what it was for - but my Dad did. Looking back, it’s obvious now that he bought it for himself, and wrapped it up for me. Within days his office had a new telephone list, and he had begun compiling a list of all the pieces of music in the various music books we owned.

Years ago, when you visited a public library, you would look up books by pulling out huge files, and flicking through thousands of pages of printouts in search of the book title you were interested in. My Dad pretty much did the same thing with all of our sheet-music. When he updated the printed list, the printer would scream for hours. I bet Mum loved it.

The computer wasn’t all about work though. Over time, we acquired all manner of games, and I continued to do really quite badly at school. My friends also acquired similar computers, and we would spend our evenings visiting each other’s houses to play and copy games instead of doing homework.

One particular friend emerged as something of a prodigy during our school years. His name was Michael, and he lived across town. His Mum was spectacularly scary. There’s no nice way of saying that. I still remember the first time I called at his house - she opened the door wearing an apron, and barked “WHAT DO YOU WANT SONNY?” at me in an aggressive Scottish accent.

Michael wasn’t like you and me. Michael understood computers - really understood them. While we could switch them on, and follow instructions to make them do things, he could take them to pieces, and change the way they worked. Before he too got an Atari ST, he had a BBC micro, and would regularly pull chips from the motherboard, explaining what he was doing as he went. I understood none of it.

It’s probably worth mentioning that Michael also built a plasma generator from an old microwave oven, and burned a hole straight through his finger with a giant pink ark of electricity by accident. He survived.

What does this have to do with the Atari ST though? Quite a lot, it turns out. In the later years of the 16 bit computer boom, a strange subculture developed of people writing “demos” - demonstrations of their know-how and brilliance. Essentially small pieces of software to showcase how much the hardware was really capable of. Michael single handedly wrote one of the most impressive demos I have ever seen - even to this day. While most people understood how to program in Basic, or C at a stretch, Michael could write assembly language - one step away from typing a mile long stream of one’s and zeros straight into the computer’s brain. Like I said - Michael was different, and brilliant.

One of the most significant developments in my world during the years we had the Atari ST was the fruition of a savings policy that my Dad had been putting money into since I was little. I think I was perhaps 16 when they money suddenly arrived in my pocket - more money than I had ever had in my life before - and my parents said I could use it for whatever I liked, as long as I chose sensible things. We returned to Evesham within days.

The computer got an immediate upgrade, doubling it’s memory, an external floppy disk drive was bought - allowing copying from one disk to another - and perhaps most significantly, a high resolution monitor was acquired. I thought I was the King of the world. You might wonder why a high resolution monitor was important - but you have to remember that back in the late 1980s, most computers used televisions, or dedicated monitors (such as the somewhat famous Phillips CM8833) - both of which were hopelessly blurry if trying to use for anything other than games. The high resolution monitor was monochrome only, but double the resolution of the colour monitors, and pin sharp. In short, you could write stories in a word processor, and not end up with eye strain.

This is all getting a bit nerdy, isn’t it - all this talk of specifications, hardware, and such like. I suppose one of the more important things that also came out of this era was community. It’s worth remembering that in the years before the internet, the only way you might interact with other computer users was via a “Computer Club” (the town I lived in didn’t have one), or by visiting friends who had computers.

It’s a strange thought really, isn’t it - visiting your friend’s house, purely so you could mess around with computers together. It seems like such a “boy” thing to do (and before you ask, I have three daughters, so I do have some perspective).

There was another means of discovering your “herd” though - each year in the run up to Christmas, a huge computer trade magazine called “Computer Shopper” ran a show in London, perhaps not surprisingly called “The Computer Shopper Show”. My Dad took me along late in 1989, and we were kind of stunned - the most computer stuff we had seen in one place was the showroom at Evesham Micros - this was an entire exhibition hall, filled to the rafters with not only trade stalls, but also exhibition stands by anybody and everybody in the industry. Many of the computer and video game manufacturers were there, and a lot of the software development houses were there too. It was vast. Beyond belief. Of course the main reason the industry was exploding had nothing to do with video game consoles, or the Atari ST, or the Commodore Amiga - the PC had begun to arrive in people’s homes.

My first experience of using a PC was really at college. I studied Computer Science, and had to learn a programming language called “Pascal” for many of the coursework assignments. The computer science lecturer was a wonderfully quirky guy called Jeremy Jackson, who walked with a limp, and sported a long dark fringe, often combed across his forehead, and a black beard.

He taught us all about Pseudocode, sorting algorithms, the fetch execute cycle, and everything else you might imagine a computer science course consisting of. I still remember the months spent working on “number processes” - the various ways computers achieve arithmetic using binary (there are all sorts of shortcuts and tricks that I won’t bore you with - looking back as an adult it’s quite interesting - but as a teenager it was sopporrifically boring). It didn’t take us long to discover that Mr Jackson would also talk at length about Star Trek if you gave him half a chance.

There are many more stories to tell about Mr Jackson, and the collection of oddball characters in the computer science class - I’ll save them for a later chapter about my college experience. For now, I really want to get back to the computers we were using.

While working through the course at college, we could all see that the PC was going to be the future. It had already won in the business world - with offices all over the world running Wordstar, Wordperfect, and Lotus 123. The fact that we were learning to program PCs said a lot - a couple of years before, students had been learning to program mainframes and mini computers running Fortran, Lisp, and Cobol.

I needed a PC at home. Actually - scratch that - I didn’t *need* a PC at home - I *wanted* a PC at home. A very different thing. I reasoned with myself that I wanted the PC in order to help me write my A-Level computer science project. We had a huge programming assignment - to build a piece of software - and the only way I would be able to do it without access to a PC at home would be to spend hours in the computer science classroom outside of lesson times.

It just so happened that I had seen something at the Computer Shopper show in London that was going to solve my problem - a beige box that could be plugged into an Atari ST to turn it into a PC, for a fraction of the cost of a PC. It still cost a significant amount of money though, and I didn’t have a source of income (cue poor student music on a violin).

I’ll write about my first job elsewhere - suffice to say that in-between my first and second years at college I worked for the family business - a quarry - sweeping floors, shovelling rubbish, and clearing up behind people for six weeks. The money earned in those six weeks bought me the box to plug into the computer at home. I finally had a PC!

I can still remember inviting Michael round, to teach me how to do things in DOS. The Atari had a graphical user interface - folders looked like folders - you could drag things around to re-arrange them. DOS has a friendly little cursor, blinking away on a blank screen, waiting for you to type commands. It was a step backwards, but for some reason I liked that it had a higher bar to entry. I wonder if that’s why I have such an affinity with Linux these days?

The Atari - along with the beige box that turned it into a PC (called a “Supercharger”, for those interested), saw me through the rest of the computer science course. The programming project I eventually wrote for the exam coursework became an example project for future years, both printed out, and given out to go through in classroom sessions. It wasn’t brilliant, but it was clean, tidy code and it was well documented. Also - I had built something useful, unlike a lot of my classmates - an order processing system for the family business.

I saw Mr Jackson a year or so later, and he commented that my project was good for many reasons - both because it was so well written, but also because there were better ways of doing so many things - opportunities to improve it. I didn’t know if I was happy or crestfallen about that.</Text>

            <Title>486</Title>
            <Text>One day, late in the autumn of 1989, my Dad floated the idea with me of selling the Atari ST, and buying a PC to replace it. We hadn’t been using the Atari for it’s original purpose - music production - for years, and it was obvious from the various magazines we occasionally bought where the future was headed. The Atari ST, and it’s long-time rival, the Commodore Amiga, were fast becoming obsolete.

The weeks that followed saw us purchase magazine after magazine - learning an entirely new lexicon of words. EGA, VGA, Ethernet, PCMCIA, and so on. We learned the difference between the 386 and 486 processors, and what a 486DX had that a 486SX did not. We didn’t know what difference it would make to us personally, but we could probably bore somebody really well if they asked us.

I even returned to my old lecturer at college, finding him in his office. I had never visited his office before, and caught him half-way through eating a cheese sandwich. He scooted his chair to one side, and invited me to sit down. I layed a copy of Personal Computer World on his desk, open at a vast list of specifications for computers available from one of the major manufacturers. Over the course of the next half an hour he explained what a maths co-processor actually does, what difference cache memory makes, and why having 4 gigabytes of RAM was a pretty good idea - all the while shaking his head that computers were now being sold with that much memory on-board.

Before saying goodbye, he rose out of his chair, smiled, and said “follow me - I want to show you something”.

We wandered back to the computer science classroom where I had spent so many hours over the last two years, but instead of heading to the classroom area, opened a door, and walked into the small server room next door. Among a mass of cables on one of the desks sat a new beige PC case, with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse attached. He wiggled the mouse, and the screen burst into life - showing a patterned background, and a prettier version of the interface we had known on the Atari ST.

It was Windows 3.0.

Sure, I had read about Microsoft Windows, and everybody knew it was coming - but actually seeing it running on a computer was a bit of a moment. After a few clicks of the mouse, “Word for Windows” opened, and he began typing letters in a smooth, serif font. I was blown away.

“That’s not the best bit - watch this.”

He leaned across the desk and retrieved a strange t-shaped device with light pouring from it’s under-side, and a cable hanging from it’s rear. After a quick look around the desk, he grabbed a coke can, and dragged the device around it’s edge. The outside of the coke can slowly appeared on the screen - it was a hand-held scanner. Again, I had read about them, but never seen on - and again, I was blown away.

“Good luck with buying your PC”, he said, as we parted ways. I must have had a smile like a coat-hanger.

The next weekend I went with my Dad to Evesham - to visit the very same computer store we had visited years before to buy the Atari ST. By now Evesham Micros had evolved into a well known maker of PCs with huge full colour adverts in all the well known computer magazines. They had also moved premises - to an industrial unit outside the town. I remember walking into their showroom, and seeing a number of huge computers, quietly humming at desks for people to look at.

When I say “huge”, I really do mean “huge”. The “tower” computer cases you tend to see tucked under desks in offices are only really “half-tower” cases - back in 1989 the first 486DX 50s were typically sold in full-tower cases - they would only just fit underneath a standard height desk. I imagine the room inside was designed to accommodate multiple hard drives, multiple floppy drives, and multiple optical drives - CDROMs had arrived too.

We waited in reception while the computer we ordered - that had been built for us - was brought through from the store room. It was one notch down from the fastest computer available at the time - a 486DX 33. The 33 reflected it’s internal clock speed in megahertz - the rate at which it could get stuff done. To give some perspective, within five years the first Pentium chips had hit 1 Gigahertz - thirty times faster.

The computer we bought cost an eye watering £3000. The same price as a low-end family car at the time. It was a non-descript beige box, with a couple of slots on the front, and came with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. While looking around the showroom in the shop, I spent the little money I had on a copy of the video game “The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy”, and a copy of “Flight Simulator 4” - the direct successor to the same game I had spent so many hours playing on the Atari ST.

When we got home, I had a considerable mountain to climb in terms of knowledge. Unlike todays PCs that come pre-installed and pre-configured, in the early days they did not. To run Windows 3.1, you needed to already be have DOS installed, and if you wanted to play games, a world of hurt lay ahead of you.

You might say I was the right kind of person, in the right place, at the right time. The software that came with the computer - MS-DOS 5, and Windows 3.1 - came with sizeable books. The DOS book ran to hundreds of pages, and looked quite impressive on the shelf. I read both of them, and over the course of perhaps a week or two, learned all about hard drives, partitioning, memory management, drivers, interrupts, address space, and lots of other things. In order to play games, I learned about expanded memory, extended memory, high memory, and the various tricks required to use them efficiently. When you switch on a Windows PC or Mac these days, you have no idea how much as been done for you by the operating system - it wasn’t always that way.

For several years I became a version of my old school friend. I was the guy that could turn up at somebody’s house, and solve their computer woes. I could get games to work. People would sit in awe as I wrote configuration files for their computers by hand. When they asked where on earth I had learned how to do it all, I always replied with the same answer - I read the books that came with the computer. They were actually REALLY good books.

Once upon a time, Microsoft Press were famous for the quality of their books. I remember seeing the set of printed books for the Windows Software Development Kit for sale at the Computer Shopper show that year - our second visit. The stack of books was two feet long, and could be bought in shrink-wrapped bulk. It was a bit like buying a set of encyclopedias.

Our computer came with a free copy of “Microsoft Bookshelf” - a compact disk that ran within Windows 3.1. It contained an encyclopedia, a dictionary, a thesaurus, and a book of quotes. It seemed magic - being able to search for pretty much any subject, and find articles to read, pictures to peruse, and sound clips to listen to at a moment’s notice. Some entries - such as the Apollo project - let you listen to speeches, and watch video clips of the event. This was quite a time before the internet became widely used, remember. The World Wide Web was still an idea Tim Berners Lee was toying with, and connecting computers to the internet at all was still perhaps two or three years away.

Each component inside the computer had an impressive sounding name - a “Diamond Stealth” graphics card, a “Soundblaster” sound card, and “American Megatrends” BIOS. It’s perhaps worth remembering that PCs started out very much as kits of components - not sealed units bought and sold as consumable items. A PC would be bought with the intention of upgrading it over time - replacing elements of it’s innards to tailor it for specific tasks - or just to make it go faster.

Although I could never warrant the cost of office software for the PC in those early days, I didn’t have to. One or other of the magazines available in the high street newsagents had DVDs on the cover, which invariably had free copies of Microsoft Office competitors software on the cover. For years I used “Lotus Smartsuite”, purely because it was free. I also reasoned with myself that it was somehow better than Microsoft Office - and back then it probably was. As has always been the way though, Microsoft slowly but surely improved their own software, and swept all before them. When was the last time you saw a copy of Lotus Smartsuite, or Wordperfect Office in the wild? Not for many years, I’ll wager.

The funny thing? Lotus Smartsuite really was better than Microsoft Office back in the early 1990s. And Borland Delphi was so much better than Microsoft Visual Basic that it wasn’t funny. Neither Borland, or Lotus exist any more.

The 486 served the family (ok, me) for about five years. It was upgraded over time - doubling it’s memory, and DOS 5 became DOS 6 - but really, it was kind of stunning that it did so well. Looking back, I suppose there was a subtle sift in the early 1990s - away from what your computer could do, towards what other computers could do.

The internet had arrived.

This isn’t the first time I have attempted it. Oh no. I think perhaps the first time was during a holiday in Tunisia, in the years before children. I took a Palm Pilot organiser with me, and a fold-out keyboard. I remember sitting on the beach, cross-legged on a towel, tapping away while holiday makers wandered past, wondering what the strange man was doing.

I tried it again a couple of years ago - and survived for about the first week before life, work, family, and the universe in general came crashing down on the attempt like a piano pushed from the back of a rather large aircraft at considerable altitude. I saw the impending crater, held my hands up, and swore I would never try again.

But here I am.

Here I am, sitting in the junk room at home (that we rather loftily call “the study”), in front of a twenty year old iMac computer, with an angle poise lamp, and a paper notepad for company. Until two hours ago I had no idea what I was going to write when midnight ticked around, but then an idea arrived rather unexpectedly in my head.

A book of me.

A series of chapters, each about different parts of my life, my memories, my thoughts, my ideas, and my opinions. A different subject each day. I’ve tentatively written out cards for each subject - I imagine I’ll fill them with words as the month progresses, picking subjects from the tree, if that makes any sense at all. Of course the risk is that I’ll bore myself to death along the way.

The story behind the iMac is an interesting one. Not withstanding that there’s a Windows 10 PC sitting across the room from me, the iMac was bought on E-Bay. As with many purchases from online auction sites, the reasons for buying it have been lost in history - I imagine it was a “good idea at the time” purchase - a deal that was too good to be true.

I remember it arriving, in a huge cardboard box, and opening it to discover a piece of computing history in remarkable condition, given it’s age. It turned out a school had been clearing a store-room out, and discovered a number of iMacs that had not been used. At all. Ever. They had sat in the school store-room for over a decade.

Of course the iMac then sat on a shelf in our junk room for a year, before being carried up to the attic for the better part of ten years. After retrieving it this time, it was doing a pretty good impersonation of a gas turbine engine, which a quick internet search narrowed down to hard drive bearing failure. I had no idea that bicycles and hard drives were so closely related, but crossed my fingers, and waited for the postman to deliver a shiny new hard drive a few days later.

If you’ve never taken an iMac apart, it’s not quite as simple as a modern computer. Most PCs and laptops have easy access to memory chips, and hard drives. I had to pretty much perform open-heart surgery on the Mac - the human equivalent of taking it’s arms and legs off, most of it’s internal organs out, and then putting everything back together in the exact reverse order that I had disassembled it - putting the right screws back into the right holes along the way.

It’s worth pointing out that although I work as a “techie”, I’m more about the software these days - being faced with a rather large meccano project that might electrocute me, I was understandably stressed.

You can’t imagine how relieved I was when, after re-assembling all the body parts, the Mac chirped back into life with the famous “Apple sound” (the same sound Wall-E makes when fully charged, if you’ve seen the movie - it just struck me that iPhones and iPads don’t make the noise, so most people will never have heard it).

Doesn’t it make you feel old, when you realise something you think of as “normal” is actually a piece of ancient history.

Anyway!

The Mac is working. It’s sitting on the desk in front of me, and it no longer sounds like a Lufthansa A320 spooling up it’s engines to takeoff from London Heathrow. It’s humming away quite quietly in the dark of the study, on the desk I cleared last week, and inviting me to write the beginnings of fifty thousand words.

I haven’t really descrived the Mac, have I. It’s one of the tear-drop shaped Macs with the CRT monitor, speakers, and CD drive all housed in one lump of plastic - with the innards visible through the sides and back of the case. This one is a deep blue colour, with pinstripes running through the grey front-facia. It wouldn’t have looked out of place in an early episode of Friends, or Will and Grace.

Isn’t it funny how the early Macintosh computers were such style icons. If you search on Youtube, you can still find the unveiling of the Mac Classic - where Steve Jobs showed off the computer that millions of writers would buy for the first time. It seems funny today, but the moment where Times New Roman lettering scrolled smoothly past was a huge moment in computer history. It’s hard to impress on younger people just how big a change it represented. Of course there is a wider story about the theft of ideas from the Xerox PARC facility, but we’ll keep quiet about that.

Let’s just agree that the iMac is quiet pretty, in a “MTV of the 1990s” kind of way.

I’m using a word processor program called “Scrivener” for this tilt at NaNoWriMo. It’s supposed to be very good for writing books. I bought it way back in the mists of time before children, when I still had disposable income, and could buy things because I liked the idea of them, rather than because I had to buy it for whatever reason.

I miss those days - when you could buy something because you liked the idea of it, and nothing more.

I remember first hearing about Scrivener while listening to Mac Break Weekly - a podcast on the TWiT network, hosted by Leo Laporte and Andy Ihnatko. Andy is a technology journalist for various US newspapers, websites, and periodicals, and is also a wonderful podcaster. He has the curious knack of being able to talk about any subject, and make it interesting - usually inter-spersed with numerous anecdotes along the way. I sometimes wonder just how many people took a chance on Scrivener because of Andy Ihnatko enthusing about it so often.

Alongside the Mac on the desk is an Iomega ZIP drive. If you were using computers at the turn of the millenium, you will probably remember ZIP drives. This particular drive (there were many versions) stores 250 gigabytes on a single disk. In old money, that’s about two hundred floppy disks. In new money, that’s about 5% of an average memory stick no bigger than your thumbnail. Oh how technology has changed.

When you slide a disk into the ZIP drive, it makes a re-assuring clunk noise, and whirs into life - it actually sounds like it’s doing something, unlike memory sticks that just sit there and cause a light to glow from time to time. I’ll be using the ZIP drive to save backups of my writing. Some might think that using twenty year old disks is a recipe for disaster, and I do too - which is why I’m not relying on them exclusively.

One of the very lovely things about the operating system on the Mac is that it’s based on Unix, which in turn means a slew of common applications are available for it that have been ported from Linux - which it turns out is a distant cousin. Cutting a long and boring story short, you can run Git on this ancient Mac, which lets me save everything I write into a version controlled database, and then push it up to the cloud for safe keeping.

Once a software developer, always a software developer. It just occurred to me that I hadn’t mentioned that yet - I’m a software developer. We use Git to save things. I’ll perhaps write more about that another day. It’s perhaps worth relating that Linus Torvalds invented Git, and has no real explanation for why it’s called Git. I love those kind of stories - where, after digging relentlessly for the facts, you find out that some major decision was made entirely by chance.

It’s nearing 1am, and I’m wondering if I should call it a night. It almost seems like cheating - racing past the quota of words for the first day on NaNoWriMo before the day has really begun. I suppose that’s working on Christmas rules though - where 2am on Christmas Day is really still Christmas Eve - or that’s what you tell your children when they wake up in the middle of the night, absolutely sure they just heard Santa. I’m a grown-up though. I know that one minute past midnight is actually the next day. This really IS the first of November, and this really is the introduction to a rather silly book about me.

Trying to decide quite what I might write about has been tumbling around in the back of my mind for the last several days. I wondered about writing a fictional novel in the manner of Microserfs, by Douglas Coupland - a love letter of sorts to all the people I’ve worked with over the years - changing their names, but instilling their characters into a madcap bunch of lunatics populating the most toxic yet entertaining office environment I could dream up.

I decided against fiction, because I thought I might get bored with it. I posted a question on my blog last week - if I should write A book, or write MY book - and several people chose the latter. A book about me. My story. My thoughts about things - as outlined earlier.

So this is it. The end. Well - the end of the beginning, otherwise this would be the shortest failed attempt at NaNoWriMo ever, probably. Actually, I bet some people have signed up and not written a word. Does that actually count though?

Tomorrow I’ll write some more, and the day after I’ll write even more - then by the end of the month we’ll see where we are. Fifty thousand words can’t be THAT difficult, can it ?</Text>

            <Title>Video Games</Title>
            <Synopsis>A video gaming history, with memories of the important machines during my teenage years. Look back at the big games too.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The first video game I ever remember seeing was in an chip shop while we were on holiday. While waiting for my Dad to buy chips, myself and my brother watched a collection of wire-frame shapes drift around the screen. We didn’t have any money to play the game, and Dad wouldn’t give us any - so all we could do was watch.

Now of course I know the game was called “Asteroids”, and was a direct ancestor of perhaps the first ever space game, “Space War”, written by the students at MIT in the 1970s.

My next brush with video games came while on holiday in Spain - our first overseas holiday as a family. We visited the “Costa Del Sol” - the fashionable place for families to visit at the turn of the 1980s, with my Mum’s brother and his family. The hotel was all inclusive, and us kids (myself, my brother, and my cousins Simon and Nathan) were given free rein around the hotel complex. Dotted around the hotel, and in cafes near it, there were coin operated arcade machines playing two video games we had never seen before - “Galaxians”, and “Phoenix”. They cost 25 pesetas per game to play. At some point my brother discovered that a british two pence coin also worked in the machines, and he became an expert at both games - well - until we ran out of two pence pieces.

I don’t remember playing the games myself - I was only about nine years old, and more concerned with going swimming than standing in the hotel, or the nearby cafe watching others play games. My brother did though - and spent hours hanging around the machines watching others play them if he hadn’t managed to beg any more money from Dad.

Thinking back, leaning on the corner of arcade machines, and watching others play was a core part of the video game experience when I grew up. If you visited an arcade, most of which looked and sounded exactly like Flynn’s in the movie Tron, you would see hoards of children and young adults congregated around their favourite games, watching, giving tips, and commenting on each other’s play.

Perhaps six months later I was doing something in the lounge after school - playing with lego probably - when I noticed Dad’s car pull up on the driveway, and my brother carry a large box into the house, with a very serious look on his face - the sort of serious look when you’re carrying the crown jewels. Or an Atari VCS 2600.

The Atari was THE games machine in the early 1980s, and my brother had one. It was plugged into the TV in the lounge, and would be played with almost to destruction. Our house became a kind of video game mecca among my brother and his friends - there are photos somewhere of the gathering on our living room floor during the summer - with perhaps four boys sitting cross legged, taking turns to have the next go.

Notice I said boys - apart from my Mum, who became addicted to the pinball game, I don’t remember any girls coming round to play on the Atari at all.

I have a vague memory that my brother “clocked” Pacman - scored a score so high that the score counter looped around. It took most of a Saturday morning to do it.

The Atari survived in our house until the MSX arrived for Christmas in 1983. Although laughably rubbish now, the games for the MSX seemed every bit as good as the arcade games we had been paying to play, so the Atari got consigned to a drawer under a bed almost immediately, and eventually given away. What fools we were - they fetch a small fortune as pieces of video game history now.

The MSX was mine. My brother had started competing in schoolbox motocross by 1983, and pretty much left video games behind. By the time I was 11, my world pretty much existed inside the computer.

I’m trying not to write too much about the MSX, or the Atari ST, because I’ve covered them elsewhere - suffice to say that the string of home computers that lead all the way to the PC sitting under the desk opposite me has been more-or-less linear from the age of 11, through to the present. Thirty-odd-years of playing games on various computers - computers were not really designed for games though. Games consoles were.

The first games console I had that was mine, and mine alone was a Nintendo Entertainment System, or “NES”. The pack I got had the console, a light gun, and a robot called “Rob” that could watch the screen and respond to commands in games. Rob was very impressive, but ate large collections of batteries for breakfast, so didn’t make it much past Boxing Day before being consigned to a shelf in my bedroom. I seem to remember the entire Christmas the Nintendo arrived being spent shooting clay pigeons, and ducks, in a game called “Duck Hunt”. Everybody that visited over Christmas played it, and was reluctant to take turns. I think my aunt actually visited in order to play it more than once.

I can still remember my brother talking me into buying a copy of Super Mario Brothers - a ridiculous video game where you ran around the screen as an improbably small Italian plumber, until you ate a mushroom, after which you doubled in size. Why am I explaining any of this? Everybody knows who Super Mario is, surely? Have you ever really thought about it though? A guy that runs round stamping on turtles, and eating mushrooms?

I never quite understood the Super Mario “mania” - I played the game through a few times, and lost interest in it pretty quickly. My brother’s first serious girlfriend had it bad - she spent most of each weekend playing the various Super Mario games to the exclusion of almost everything else.

The next console to enter the house was almost certainly a Sega Megadrive - bought with money from a summer job. My brother had borrowed one from a work colleague for a weekend, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing - there were Ice Hockey, and American Football games where the playing areas seemed to be in 3D - it blew our minds. Suddenly the Nintendo was a bit rubbish. It didn’t stop me ending up buying both a Megadrive (known as “Genesis” in the US), and a SNES - the successor to the Nintendo.

The SNES had one party trick that no other console at the time could get anywhere near matching - it was called “Mode 7”, and allowed the machine to smoothly rotate a picture in three dimensions. Have you ever seen Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo? Without Mode 7, Mariokart would never have existed. Mode 7 was also used in Super Soccer, and Super Tennis. Most of the games for the Super Nintendo began with “Super” - when in reality very few of them actually were. Super Mario World was though, and almost got me interested in being a mushroom eating, turtle smashing Italian plumber again.

I remember visiting my little cousin on boxing day the year the Super Nintendo was the “toy to have”, and seeing her Dad crouched in front of the TV. He had caught the Super Mario bug too. He and his wife argued over who’s go it was next throughout Christmas. Actually, they argued most of the time, and would later get divorced, but we’ll keep out of that one.

            <Title>Working at ABS</Title>
            <Text>My arrival at my new employer could be described best as accidentally falling from a moving car, and landing completely unscathed, on your feet.

A few short days ago I had been watching the world go by from the window of a portacabin in a hell hole. I now had my own desk, my own computer, my own chair, my own stapler, my own pens, pencils, ruler, pen holder - you name it.

While admiring all my new toys, I remember the middle-aged man sitting directly in front of me spinning around in his office chair, and breaking the ice as naturally as most other people might breathe.

“Right then young John. Is it John or Jonathan?”

“I don’t mind.”

“Tea or coffee?”

“Oh! Coffee please”

“If you come with me, I can show you where everything is, and I’ll introduce you to some of the useless rabble. They’re less use than a chocolate fireguard, you know”.

And so was my introduction to the world of Dave Lines, conservatory salesman, draghtsman, and harmless bullshitter extraordinaire. He stood about 5′ 8″ tall, was in his early 60s, a little portly, with 60s style horn rimmed glasses, and a tangle of curly black hair combed into a curl perched high atop his forehead. If anybody looked like a mischievous character from a childrens comic, he did.

While we made coffee in the kitchen area, he told me how he had been poached from another construction company where he had been in charge of sales – and was now senior to one of the other salesman who he had worked for many years previously – Jack Godwin, geriatric World War 2 fighter ace (or at least that was the impression Jack liked to project).

The ill feeling between Dave and Jack was my earliest introduction to office politics, and the concept that some people didn’t so much want to get on with one another, as actively want to set fire to one another if given the chance. I was oblivious to it at this early stage in my education – it would take many apparently unprovoked slanging matches between fellow colleagues before I started to sense the warning signs and retreat to a safe distance.

Apparently women are far better at sensing these things than men.

It’s amazing how much you can find out about somebody while helping them make a round of teas and coffees. It turned out Mr. Lines (everybody called him “Mr Lines”, apart from the boss, who called him by his first name) had been a radar technician on HMS Ark Royal during the 1960s. He hinted at all manner of adventures while serving in the Navy all over the world.

Perhaps his favourite claim was that had once been a test pilot in a knocking shop. I often couldn’t figure out if athe stories Dave told were the truth or not.

The first desk on the way back through the office was the company secretary and book keeper.

“This is the lovely Sonia. She pays us adoring staff and we do anything she asks us to. Isn’t that right?”

“Hello Jonathan – nice to finally meet you! we heard there was a young lad starting that was a whiz with the computers. Actually, do you know anything about Wordstar?”

I peered at her screen with an interested look. In reality, all I actually knew about WordStar was that it was a very famous word processor I had never seen, and it was chiefly famous because it used key combinations not used by any other piece of software in the known universe.

“I can’t remember how to save”

Another voice drifted up the office “press F2” (thank god – I had no idea). Either Wordstar or Wordperfect - I don’t remember which - was famous because the key combination for print, and the key combination for “exit without saving” were almost identical.

Sonia was in her early 50s, and immaculately turned out. Her hair seemed to have come from a Nicky Clarke brochure, and had perhaps two entire cans of hairspray reinforcing it’s just-so look. Later in the week when she would appear at the end of the day from the rest rooms wearing lycra leggins, a running club t-shirt, and running shoes. For a moment I found myself admiring her in the way young men tend to when faced with such a sight.

Sonia took tea with one sugar. I knew I would forget, but at least tried to sound like I was going to remember.

Mr Lines reminded me at a volume the entire office could hear that Sonia was the most important person to be nice to, on account of her paying our wages. One guy grinned as he walked past, trying to look busy.

Next up was a bubbly looking girl introduced as Dave’s assistant.

“No I’m bloody not you old bugger!”

She then laughed in a high pitch whoop - sounding not entirely dissimilar to a U-Boat dive claxon. This was Angie – happiest, funniest, and perhaps the most optimistic person I would meet for years to come. Angie was larger than life in more ways than one – voluptuous, loud, and apparently very good at producing offspring. She had photos of three children of varying ages stuck on the wall next to her desk.

“Oooo – thankyou for the drink – you got it right too!”

“He didn’t make it, I did, and you’re lucky I did – get on with your work!”

Dave liked to think he was Angie’s boss, when in reality she just took overflow work from him on top of her own work. In his previous job he had been an executive in a much larger company, and given the era of the earlier part of his career (the Jurassic), Dave didn’t always see women as equals. If there was a position free within the office for “male chauvenist pig”, he was in the lead by quite some distance. He wasn’t nasty, or mean spirited - he just came from a different generation entirely, when the world had been a very different place.

The little chap that had bustled past earlier now reappeared and blocked our continued route through the office. Before he even said a word you could tell he thought he was terrifically funny, astoundingly good looking, and remarkably clever. Call it an air of confidence – or call it being a born wanker. Probably not the best first impression to have of somebody – and totally wrong as it turned out.

I can remember his introduction like it was yesterday.

“Hello Jonathan, I’m Dave, and I’m the Sheriff of Chickensaw County”

He was wearing a toy sheriff’s badge, attached to his pinstrip shirt.

Mr Lines jumped in… “this is Dave, younger brother of GGL, our ‘Great and Glorious Leader’”

Dave was 5ft 4ish, stockily built, and took an obvious pride in looking good. I got the feeling that being over 6ft tall was an issue for him somewhere deep in his psyche. His flat-top haircut was worryingly immaculate. I couldn’t help feeling that behind his blow and bluster there was something terrifically insecure about him – perhaps a need to be liked – and I couldn’t help liking him. Lots of people didn’t like him, but I did.

I remember the phone on his desk ringing, him picking it up, and shouting “Alright Minnie!” while pushing his glasses up his nose. I probably started to wonder about the sanity of people working in office at that point.

Dave pointed over to the corner of the room, and a middle aged guy hunched over his desk, his forehead cradled in one hand, and the phone clasped against his ear in the other. He was wearing a grey suit, and looked strangely reminscent of Will Carling.

“That’s Graham – he’s in charge of the fitters out on the road”

Graham had a childish smile – a complete contrast from the furrowed brow you might normally see him with. I got the impression that he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Graham and Dave’s desks faced each other. Between them there was a huge slotted board attached to the wall with several hundred multi-coloured cards in it. Apparently this was the height of their invention – their work tracking system – and the smooth running of the business rested upon it. It was one of the things I would be replacing.

Next up was Steve - the boss - often referred to as “The Great and Glorious Leader” by Mr Lines.

Steve usually said nothing when voices were raised in th e office. I say “usually”, because there was this one time - when Dave and a fiery co-worker called “Kate” had a toe-to-toe argument in the middle of one of the offices. I think it was perhaps the only time I ever saw Steve summon anybody to his office.

Steve was difficult to figure out. Early 40s, untidy (as evidenced by the mound of manuals, printouts, brochures, folders, and various pieces of window and conservatory littering his desk), and obviously incredibly intelligent. I would later learn that he arrived before anybody else, and left after everybody else most days. He was divorced, and had two sons at school who lived with their mum. He was stocky like his younger brother, but seemed to have the greater share of the height genes – standing as tall as me, but with a rugby player build.

Perhaps nudged by our mutual astral travelling accountant friend, he had hired me to help grow the company - to install and network computers on everybody’s desks. To invent software, and in doing so create a competitive advantage that would be jealously guarded as the staff swelled towards 200, and we all learned about being managers.

A little while later in the day - while feeding an endless supply of floppy disks into the computer on my desk, I heard Captain Hook’s laugh drift up the office. I stopped what I was doing and looked up.

A sharp suited, bryl cream haired head was striding purposely through the office, bellowing confident morning greetings to anybody and everybody who made eye contact.

It was Count Dracula. With Dustin Hoffman’s Captain Hook voice, and a gap between his front teeth. Apparently this was what a real, live salesman looked like.

“Aha! What do we have here then ?”

Oh crap. Count Dracula was heading my way.

It turned out his name was David Heasman, and he sold conservatories to unsuspecting garden centre owners up and down the land. He probably drank their blood too. As a first example in my short career of a professional salesman, he was instructive. The crease of his trousers could probably be used as a weapon, as could the shine of his shoes. He was perhaps fifty-something years old, and sported a face bedecked with lines undoubtedly forged by innumerable stories of life on the road. And fake tan.

After shaking hands (his were cold), I politely introduced myself and started retelling the story of my arrival.

I got the impression during our few moments of conversation that he had only heard selected words;

“…. computer… help….. .. …… …. computer.. …… ….. easier…. …. … … help … …… …. computer”

“So young John, you’re one of these computer whizzes then ?”

I guessed technology in transylvania is pretty thin on the ground.

“My computer at home isn’t working right at the moment. Do you think you know what might be up with it?”

Classic. Absolutely bloody classic. I had never seen his computer, and he had provided no explanation what so ever about the problem it’s experiencing. I smiled in the most non commital way possible.

“Steve made us start using computers last year. I can’t see them taking off you know – all they ever do is get in the way, go wrong, and make things take longer. Give me a pocket book every time”

He fished a small spiral bound notebook from the inside pocket of his suit and waved it around in a proud manner. He then opened in at a fresh page, and wrote “see! it works!”.

“See – this doesn’t need batteries. Works anywhere. Fits in your pocket. Doesn’t take hours to switch on, and never goes wrong”.

“And if I tip my coffee over it you’re in trouble”

“Ha haaaaa” (the spirit of Hook was never far away when he laughed). A look of condescending smugness envoloped his orange face – “If I tip my coffee over your computer, you’ll be buggered too”

Fair point. Hopefully he might have gotten electrocuted doing it though.

In these early days among new colleagues I had no idea where the boundaries lay in terms of ignoring such obvious (and common) resistance to change, so agreed with his stance on technology – at least to his face anyway.

While politely listening to a monologue detailing the life of David Heaseman, international man of mystery, I failed to notice that an impressive looking elderly gentleman in a tweed suit was propped on the edge of Sonia’s desk, busily charming her in the style that Terry Thomas might have.

I didn’t need to be told who it was. This had to be Jack Godwin DFC. He stood smartly upright and straightened his suit jacket before striding imperiously through the office, greeting staff affably along his way with a warm smile, and relaxed wave.

“Morning Jack”

“Good morning Angela”

“Morning Jack!”

“Good morning young David”

Wow. This was some respect. At perhaps seventy years old, he stood 6ft tall, and was immaculately turned out. Whereas Heasman radiated half truths and tomfoolery, Jack had charm, warmth and personality by the bucketload. He also had quite possibly the shiniest bold head and perfectly manicured moustache I had ever seen.

“Good morning young Jonathan – lovely to meet you”

He knew my name. I was impressed.

I decided his voice would not have been unsuitable for a 1930s BBC news report. RAF English – clear, with each sentence carefully considered. No ums. Everything about him really was impressive. After demonstrating an incredibly firm/bone crunching handshake, he leaned over my desk conspiratorially.

“You’re doing fine young man – no need to look so worried”

I smiled back, and listened as he recounted his personal history to me in the way of an extended greeting. Apparently he had fought in the war as a Mosquito pilot in Canada. Something in the back of my mind told me that he might therefore never have seen any action, but I didn’t say a word. I decided he probably lived in the home counties with his jolly hocky sticks wife, drove a lumbering car, and smelled of peppermints.

Presently the two salesmen wandered down to the end office with Steve, and started talking animatedly about a hand drawn graph on the whiteboard.

Dave whispered across to Mr. Lines – “Hey - he’s not met Beaker yet!”

Dave laughed a sudden shouted stage laugh.

The other Dave stood up, and did his best muppet impersonation.

David was suddenly a bullying 10 year old, picking on some unfortunate salesman who hadn’t arrived in the office yet. It was no wonder he had divorced so young. Apparently Beaker’s real name was Tony.

I sat for a minute, laughing politely as David explained with great enthusiasm how Tony had improbably cartoon like tufts of hair growing from his ears, and talked by tipping his entire head back. My polite laughter was taken as encouragement, and David’s act became ever more exciteable. If he had indeed been 10 years old, he would have thrown up his fizzy pop at any moment.

Sonia leaned round the corner – “Stop it you lot – he’s coming!” – accompanied by a withering, scowling stare for David.

Into the office walked the living embodiment of a real, breathing muppet. Not quite the larger than life depiction given by the child sat across the room from me, but the likeness was there. His tall, gangling, unsteady gate combined with thick glasses turned him unintentionally into a comic turn.

He waved through the conservatory/office windows to Steve, Jack and the other salesmen, and took two goes to open the door.

Mr Lines got up from his desk and opened the window.

“Lets get a bit of fresh air in here”

Angie was not impressed. She often wore thin tops, and was no doubt aware of the effect the cold air was going to have. She was also certainly aware of letcherous old buggers opening windows.

Mr Lines started signing a song about wind blowing up ladies skirts.

I would later learn that Mr Lines had a song for every eventuality, occaision, or happeneing that could possibly occur. The songs were always “colourful”, no doubt harking from the time he spent in her Majesty’s Royal Navy.

A little while later in the day - while making another round of drinks, I came across an older, bigger version of David – only with dark hair and more scruffy. He was busily eating a chocolate bar while waiting for the kettle to boil.

“Nice to meet you”

He turned and smiled.

“Bad luck sitting across from my brother”

This, it turns out, was Ian, the middle brother. Perhaps the most academically gifted of the brothers, he turned drawings of buildings into instructions that the craftsmen in the workshop could understand. Cutting lists. Measurements. Plans. It also turned out he was an outstanding squash player, and the only family man (in the traditional sense) of the three brothers.

He discovered I didn’t play squash, which made me somewhat less attractive. I had actually played once with a friend, but nearly killed myself just hitting the damn ball back. Apparently it gets easier – I never progressed past “this is f*cking impossible”.

“Me and my mate fat bloke play a couple of times a week – you should come down with us after work”

I smiled, and carried on making the coffees – and spied the box of chocolate bars.

“Hows does that work then ? How much are they?”

“You just put your money in the tin. I expect it’s all going to be stopped soon though – our Mum, who’s the cleaner buys the chocolate from the big Sainsbury in town a couple of times a month. The workshop have started dibbing in though and not paying. Tossers.”

Although I had heard of the stereotypical “them and us” divide that traditionally existed between office and workfloor staff, this was my first real experience of it. White collar and blue collar… except in this case, the workshop staff wore various combinations of hoodies, jeans, and t-shirts advertising various beer drinking accomplishments.

A tour of the workshop was planned for later in the week apparently. The name “Mr Herring” was mentioned by several people. Some kind of alpha male pub quiz genius ape.</Text>

            <Title>Blogging</Title>
            <Synopsis>A retrospective of my history with blogging - from the first Thought Cafe webpage, through the website, blogger, wordpress, vox, livejournal, MySpace, and so on. Thoughts about blogging.</Synopsis>
            <Text>I have been writing a personal blog on the internet on-and-off since 2001, and I have pretty good records of my posts from 2003 onwards. Over time I have gone through periods of posting every day, sometimes multiple times a day, and at other times have vanished for days or weeks on end. I always return though. It's very strange.

I thought it might be interesting to tell the story about how I came to start blogging in a little more depth than I have before.

Where to start ?

I had been tinkering with the LAMP development platform (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) for a few weeks - building out the new version of the ThoughtCafe website. I had learned how to store text in a database, how to submit forms and capture the text, and how to present that text back onto webpages. It occurred to me that text was easier than anything else, because you don't have to encode or decode it - you just store the text in the database, and get it back out again.

I'm not entirely sure how the next part of the story unfolded. I think there had been a conversation at work about the "Web 2.0" movement - the web was becoming democratized, with people generating their own content - building their own castles - and platforms were popping up everywhere allowing you to express yourself in ways that had not existed before.

I spent one lunchtime building out a diary on the free webspace my internet service provider gave me - allowing me to post entries for my own benefit - almost like a "captain's log" on a ship. I used all the new toys to do it, and ended up chatting with the other developers in the office about how it worked. Towards the end of lunch, one of the other developers wandered into the office - stretching his legs after sitting at his desk all morning - and took an interest in what I was doing.

"That's a blog."

"A what?"

"A blog. A couple of my friends have started writing them - a public journal on the internet."

I explained that the bigger goal was actually ThoughtCafe, and that I had just knocked this up during lunchtime for my own use.

"If you added a login page to it, you could release it as open source".

I knew what open source software was of course - I just hadn't been involved in any open source projects before. For the benefit of those who have no clue, I suppose a short history lesson is the best place to start.

Many years ago the various universities around the world had computer systems that were run by a priesthood of trained staff. Over time the software running on those systems was opened to the faculty and students to extend and improve - that's how an awful lot of the lower level software tools we take for granted today - such as text editors, file system utilities and so on came about - students wanted computers to be easier to use, so they could use them more easily. It makes a lot of sense.

A computer operating system called "Unix" gradually became something of a standard on large computer systems - having a standard had all sorts of advantages in terms of common course materials, shared knowledge, experience, and so on. It's fair to say that Unix therefore owed a tremendous debt to the teams of students that extended and improved it. The software they wrote essentially "completed" the operating system. 

And then something terrible happened - the various flavours of Unix (there were many) became commercial projects. Suddenly those that had worked to build the system - each standing on the shoulders of those before, and sharing code with each other along the way - were not allowed to share anything any more. The source code was owned by the owners of Unix, and it had commercial value.

As you can imagine, those that had worked on Unix were incensed. Some more so than others. One in particular far more so than anybody else - so much in fact, that he started re-writing every part of Unix from scratch, and invented a new form of license (called "Copyleft") to protect the source code from ever being controlled by commercial interests. We now know that licensing model as "GPL". The developer was Richard Stallman.

Stallman's life became a crusade of sorts - spreading advocacy about open source, or "free" software - with an emphasis on "free as in beer" - not "free as in speech". Of course most people know what happened next - the group led by Stallman wrote all of the tools associated with the operating system, but didn't have a kernel - the central part that talks to the hardware. By pure chance in the same time-frame a student in Finland built himself an operating system kernel, and released it as open source. His name was Linus Torvalds, and he called it "Linux".

So - by the time I wrote my little script over a lunchtime in 2001, Linux had trampled the entire web hosting world under-foot, and the open source movement had grown like an avalanche - threatening to swallow a lot of the software giants that had ruled the previous decades. The likes of Microsoft and Apple were genuinely worried about their continued existence. Repositories had popped up like weeds on the world wide web - where you could upload source code to share with the world. After tidying my little script up a bit, I uploaded it to a site called "Hotscripts", that seemed to be quite popular.

The response was staggering. I suppose on reflection I lucked into several things - I was the first project at hotscripts called "Blog", and the only way of writing a blog online back then was to host it yourself - there was no Facebook, MySpace, Blogger, Wordpress, or anything else yet. If you did a search for the word "blog", you tended to find the guy that coined the term "weblog". Over the course of the next 48 hours the script was downloaded several hundred times - and not only were people downloading it, they were trying it out, suggesting improvements, and actively using it.

For the next year or so I accidentally found myself in charge of an open source software development project in my free time. The blog script improved over time - adding an administration interface, multiple user accounts, multiple language support, themes, comments, replies, likes - all the things we now come to expect when we visit any sort of vaguely social website. The community around it grew too - with other people also working on the code - improving it - evolving it - and folding their improvements back in.

And then one day something crazy happened. Novell (who used to be a big deal) released their own distribution of Linux for commercial use, and bundled with it a number of open source web projects. My little blog solution got bundled with Novell Linux. They didn't ask me of course - the first I knew was when commercial organisations all over the world started e-mailing in questions.

For the next year or so I carried on looking after the blog project - and occasionally used it myself to post thoughts to the world wide web. Most of my readers were the community of people also using the blog, but it was all good - we became an unlikely group of friends.

And then something happened.

At some point in 2003 a friend I had made through ThoughtCafe in San Francisco (yes, Carli - it was you) told me about a new solution she had installed to write her blog, and that I should take a look at it. It was called "WordPress". A guy called Matt Mullenweg had forked an earlier software development project called b2/cafelog, and carried on developing it himself.

The appearance of Wordpress was fortuitous in a way. I had never set out to build or run an open source project - I was a software and web developer in the daytime anyway - it felt like being submerged the entire time - like there was no escape from people wanting things, asking for things, or complaining about things. Within months I stopped updating my own script, and switched to Wordpress. I started writing my own words, rather than enabling others to write theirs.

It's worth remembering that the whole "Web 2.0" movement was in full swing in the early 2000s too - so there were new platforms appearing almost every week, it seemed - lowering the bar for would-be bloggers to get online, and start posting their words - blogging became fashionable.

I tried everything out. Over the course of the next couple of years I had accounts at Blogger, LiveJournal, Vox, Yahoo 360, TypePad, MySpace, and lots of others - but always seemed to return to Wordpress. I stared writing more often, and gained a few friends along the way too.

I still remember signing up for a damn-fool idea called "NaBloPoMo" (National Blog Posting Month) in 2006 - the slightly odd "me too" step-sister of NaNoWriMo. During November you had to post to your blog every single day. It seemed like a mountain to climb at the time - but then you have to remember that posting to a blog was very much a "sit at your desk" activity back then - the only smartphones you ever saw were odd devices called a "Blackberry" that seemed to be the exclusive property of important businessmen on trains.

I made lasting friendships during November of 2006. The more names I think of, the more come to mind - Rodney in Australia, Sarah in Michigan, Amy in Illinois, Victoria in Canada, Lauren in Connecticut, and Lisa in Oklahoma. Some of them are still writing, all these years later, some have stopped, and some are no longer with us. Lisa died in a car accident a few years later, and become the first person I have known through the internet to die. I can still remember the email I received from a common friend, and sitting in shock at work - digging through news stories on the web - scratching around for the story.

For a few years the discovery of my blog made me somewhat interesting to others. Blogging was fashionable for a time, and everybody seemed to be starting their own. I remember traveling to London in 2007 on the train for work, and reading almost daily guides in newspapers walking you through the steps required to get started. The visitor numbers for my own blog were ridiculous - hundreds of people a day seemed to be reading my posts, with no effort to attract them at all.

And then - almost as suddenly as blogging became fashionable - the fascination melted away. I'm sure you could point all sorts of fingers at all sorts of things - such as the release of the iPhone in 2007, and the emergence of the social internet - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and so on - but I don't think it was any one thing in particular. I tend to think blogging was an "easy" solution - something that was easy, and inexpensive to build, and to do - so lots of people did it.

Of course the far more difficult thing is writing words that others might want to read - if that's your end goal. I'm going to be quite controversial now, and put forward the hypothesis that most of the people that started blogging when it became fashionable are the same kind of person that have reduced the social networks to a barrage of clothing try-on hauls, makeup tutorials, and photo galleries of expensive dinners in exclusive restaurants. All they really want is attention - the means to acquire attention is really secondary to it. They were never writing a blog because they like the activity of writing - they were there to attract readers, full stop.

I suppose there is a part of me that wants others to find my writing - but it's not really about attention for me - it's more about observing, recording, and connecting. 

So! I think that probably brings us up to date. For the last several years my blog has existed at Wordpress, and Tumblr. I still change my mind about Tumblr from time to time, but there is a wonderful community there that make it difficult to walk away from. Wordpress of course has become a juggernaut - a standard - a piece of the internet firmament. Posting my words into the great Wordpress morass often feels like throwing a needle into a warehouse full of haystacks, but it's all good. There's just as much chance of somebody interesting finding my needles as anybody elses.</Text>

            <Title>9 Davis Close</Title>
            <Synopsis>Memories of living at Davis Close - the house, the Hill, the neighbors.</Synopsis>
            <Text>When I was five years old we moved to a much bigger house on the other side of town. Suddenly I had my own bedroom, a new garden to explore, and new friends to make that lived nearby. To begin with we couldn’t afford much - I remember going to bed for some time on bare floorboards. When carpet did finally arrive, it was the late 1970s carpet so many people had - a synthetic off-yellow foam packed carpet that could generate real lightning bolts if you slid your socks on it fast enough.

The kitchen was lined with “G-Plan” units, surrounding a pine dinner table - my Mum’s first major purchase in the new house, and her pride and joy. I still can’t imagine her horror when one of my brother’s friends pulled a model knife across the table while building an Airfix model kit, a few days after it’s delivery. Years later we discovered she had shut herself in the toilet and cried.

Here’s the thing about my parents - about twenty years ago now they retired early - and moved to the coast (I’ll tell the story elsewhere), and people started making snap judgements I guess - that they were wealthy enough to do that - that they had always been that wealthy - and they could not be further from the truth.

If I get anything from my parents, it’s my work ethic, and the value of everything - even the smallest things. As mentioned - I had no carpet on my bedroom floor for quite some time - neither did the rest of the house. The house got furnished bit-by-bit as things could be afforded, and by golly those things were looked after. My Mum stopped working when we were young, so she cooked, cleaned (our house, and our grandparents house), did the grocery shopping, and walked us to and from school every day. I can still remember the excitement of the first new television we had - of it having a remote control, and teletext.

I had only ever known teletext at my Grandparents house. My Dad’s Dad was a life-long gadget freak - from the hilarious frankenstein three-phase switch he had installed on the cooker in the kitchen one day (Nan never let him forget it), to the calculator watch he proudly showed everybody in later years - that he had no idea how to use. Teletext was magic though - you could key a number into the television, and after a few minutes wait, a page of text would appear. Most people used it for TV listings, or the weather forecast - I used it to read jokes. Looking back, it was hilariously slow and convoluted, but in was the closest we would get to an internet-like experience for at least another ten years.

The house at Burswin Road had been a bungalow - sold to my parents by my Uncle when his marriage failed, and he ran away to sea in the merchant navy to find himself. The new house had an upstairs. This was huge - because - stairs! I can’t begin to count the number of times myself and my brother were told off for running up and down the stairs, skidding down the stairs, jumping down the stairs, and so on. If it involved any amount of daring, or stupidity, we probably put each other up to it. Stairs aren’t without their dangers though - many years later my Dad was stumbling around in the dark early one morning, when he fell down the stairs - putting a foot through the banister half-way down, and trapping himself, upside down, battered and bruised, and furious. We thought the house was falling down - or that there was an earthquake. Then we heard a quiet call from my Mum as she rushed from their bedroom;

“Dave? Are you alright?”

She turned the landing light on, and saw him, upside down, holding his trapped leg, with his eyes tightly shut;

“WHAT THE FUCKING HELL DO YOU THINK!”, he shouted at the top of his voice.

I’m still not sure how we didn’t laugh.

At five years old the garden at the new house seemed to go on for miles - I remember digging around in what had once been a rockery at the far end, and finding the remains of a dog from many years before - I proudly took the skull into the kitchen to show Mum, and was shouted at pretty spectacularly.

Our golden retriever, “Ben”, thought the garden was fantastic, and wasted no time in dumping spectacularly all over it. I think one of my first chores at the new house was walking around the garden with a refuse sack, and a shovel. Not fun - particularly in the summer, when you had to fight the flies to retrieve what the dog had proudly left for you.

After a few days we began to discover the next door neighbours. The house was in the bottom of a col-de-sac, so was surrounded by other family homes. To our immediate right lived a dinner lady I had known from infant school - Mrs Ruddock. She had a son and daughter who were older than us - I inherited her son’s collection of “Look-In” magazines - an early weekly teen magazine filled with stories about the pop-stars of the day. I seem to remember a recurring photo comic-strip about somebody becoming best friends with Limahl from Kajagoogoo, and having all sorts of innocent adventures with him. I also inherited an accoustic guitar, which I never did learn to play properly.

To the left side of the house, an old scottish woman lived on her own. She was feared by all of the children in the neighbourhood - mostly because the footpath outside her house had a slight incline up to a grassy area that swept behind the row of houses. We always referred to the area at the top of that footpath as “on the hill”, even though the grass was only a few feet higher than the road.

The inclined section of footpath was of course a natural ramp - and we are talking about 1979. BMX bikes hadn’t arrived yet, but all the bike designs were headed that way. As children came hurtling along the footpath towards “The Hill”, with hopes of a spectacular Evil-Kinevil style stunt, the old scottish woman would either bash on her window, or come dashing from the house, shouting at you all to go away.

One day years later, the council put railings on the footpath ramp, stopping all the fun. I was old enough by then not to care very much, but the younger children in the street thought their world had come to an end (well - those not small enough to carry on hurtling under the railings without taking any notice of them).

My brother and I got BMX bikes in about 1983. Apparently I came down from my bedroom on Christmas morning and walked straight past my new bike in the hallway. My grandparents were staying with us over Christmas, and asked me to go look in the hallway - I walked back through, straight past it for a second time, and my Granddad laughed in that long “hahaaaaa” way he had of laughing.

We treated those bikes like they were made of gold. For my brother, the BMW was a tremendous upgrade - he had previously had a Raleigh Grifter - a bike that seemed to be made from leftover parts from a construction site. You know when you see a motorbike rider struggling to pick a bike up after falling off it? The grifter was like that - made from lead pipe and angle-iron probably. If you had run into a brick wall with it, there was every chance you would have been fine, and the wall would have disintegrated on impact. That didn’t stop my brother from trying to jump the grifter on “the hill” though.

I can still remember his final attempt. The Grifter was equipped with Sturmey Archer drum gears - operated from a lever on the handlebars. This meant it could reach pretty death defying speeds. Unfortunately drum gears tended to also incorporate an accidental “slip gear”, where all resistance was removed from the pedals without warning - removing the rider’s ability to have children at a moment’s notice. And that’s almost what happened to my brother. Just as he reached perhaps thirty miles an hour (not bad going for a 9 year old) on his two ton bike, immediately outside our house - with yards left until the base of “the hill”, the bike went into slip gear. I can still see him sliding along the footpath in his nylon running shorts, everybody stopping in a stunned silence, and then him getting up, dancing about a bit while beginning to cry, and then running indoors.

He didn’t come out, but we heard him. Other kids in the neighbourhood knocked on our door to see if he was ok - when in reality all they really wanted to see was how gruesome it really was. He had to wear shorts for WEEKS.

Davis Close provided a wonderful childhood. Apart from the odd strange neighbour (I’m sure every street has them), we lucked into moving in during a time when lots of children of similar ages also lived in the street - and as children do, we made friends immediately. Their was Claire, and Anna, the daughters of the local policeman that lived opposide. There was the very friendly (later discovered very homosexual) man that lived next door to them, the scottish couple (everybody called her Aggie, but I don’t think it was her real name) and her quiet husband, then “The Pinks”. I think they moved to England in the 1950s along with lots of other immigrants from Africa, Asia, India, and the Carribean - they had a beautiful daughter that turned heads when she walked home from work called “Monique”. Further along the road lived “The Seaths” - a family from Wales - the Dad became the manager of the local newspaper shop, and his daughters firm friends of my brother and I. At the far end of the street a little Irish man called Sean always seemed to be working on his garden. I think this was a ruse - to trap people in conversation as they wandered past. If you got caught by Sean, you were there for quite some time. His wife Cynthia would either excuse herself from conversations before they got started, or interrupt him to allow your escape - a co-conspirator of sorts, that he had no idea about. 

Like I said - we were lucky. Lucky to have such wonderful friends and neighbours. We were probably shaped far more than we ever realised by the friendships, games, and idiotic scrapes we got into. It’s interesting - looking on Google Street View - to see the old house, and wonder how many more children have grown up in the houses on that street - and if they still all play in the road together on an evening after school. Somehow, with the advent of computers, and the internet, I doubt it.

I think we saw the beginning of that happening with the family that lived on the end. The Dad was a salesman for some sort of engineering company, and the Mum was a nurse. They had a pretty daughter called Julie that was really a bit too proud of her body for her Mum’s liking, and a son called Andrew that we rarely saw. Actually - scratch that - from the point Andrew was perhaps seven or eight, we didn’t see him for perhaps five or six years. Eight bit computers arrived just in time to capture his imagination. For all I know, he’s a dot com millionaire now.

I lived at Davis Close with my parents until my mid-twenties. During those latter years I really lost touch with everybody in the street, because the only times I saw anybody was while going to work, coming home from work, or heading out for a night out. Sean would still stop me in the street to say hello, but beyond that, the only people I really knew were the next door neighbours.

Mrs Ruddock moved away when I was perhaps eleven years old - I seem to remember conversations between my parents about the company her husband worked for going broke, I really have no idea though. Mr and Mrs Griffiths replaced them - she was a supply teacher at the secondary school, and he was a high ranking officer in the Royal Air Force. They had two children - a boy called Paul, and a girl called Hannah, who we became friends with immediately. Paul was a few years younger, but age doesn’t make much difference before you become a teenager - not in my experience anyway.

I don’t want this trip down memory lane to become an essay filled with foaming invective about elitism and snobbishness - but I will say that as soon as Paul was about nine years old he was packed off to boarding school. When he returned the next summer, he was a very different person - no longer mixing with any of us. I suppose it was my first experience of any sort of class system, and I didn’t like it one bit.

One day - while home from school at lunchtime - there was a knock on the door, and Mrs Griffiths stood in our doorway, asking for me. I rushed to the door - wondering what on earth I might have done wrong (a natural reaction to anybody asking for me - even now) - and discovered that she had locked herself out of her house, and could I break in through the open upstairs bedroom window above the flat roof for her ?

A few minutes later, after pretending I was some sort of cat-burglar, I let her back into her own house, and was given a hug for my troubles. I can’t tell you how many shades of crimson I probably turned. I also realised that day that any ideas of a career as a cat burglar were gone - although I pretended I was brave while stood on her roof, my knees were shaking so badly I thought I might collapse.

Can you even imagine the insurance claim - “I broke my arm after the eleven year old boy that was breaking into my bedroom fell off the roof and kicked me”.

The Griffiths family eventually moved - I think Mr Griffiths was posted to a different area of the country with the Air Force - it had happened to a lot of my friends over the years.

They were eventually replaced by the Knight family - she was something to do with every social group imaginable at the air base, and he was an ex-fighter pilot, now teaching pilots to fly VC-10s. They had children too - younger than my brother and I, but pleasant enough. For several years I thought the son incredibly funny because he picked up his father’s RAF radio voice, and spoke incredibly correctly. All of this reverse-snobbishness flew out of the window when he took my flying one day (part of an effort to get his flying hours up), and I found out just how useful a perfect, clipped RAF English accent was when communicating on the radio. My entire view of him changed - seeing the usually distracted, daydreaming boy from next door become a thoroughly professional pilot.

Occasionally, while cutting the grass in the back garden, stories would be told about past adventures. Mr Knight had been scrambled on Christmas morning one year during the tail-end of the cold war. He had flown Phantoms - racing out over the north sea to turn Russian bombers around.

I can’t imagine what that must be like for forces families at the sharp end - knowing that each day an exercise might be the real thing - and that somebody might not come home.

The Knights were our next-door neighbours right up until our house was sold in 2000. And therein lies a story - but I’ll tell you about Mr Mays first.

When we moved into the street when I was young - as mentioned earlier - there was an old scottish woman that lived next door. I don’t remember if she moved away, died, or moved into a home - but eventually she was replaced by an engineer that had retired from London. His name was Mr Mays, and he lived alone with his dog “Bob”, a black labrador, and a sister that regularly visited in a muddy estate car.

Years later we discovered that Mr Mays moved away from the city because he saw so many of his co-workers retire, and sink into a life of pubs, beer, and not much else. He was determined that wasn’t going to happen to him, so bought a house in a small town in the Cotswolds, and left everything he had known behind.

We heard banging and crashing in his garage for years. Literally years - and always wondered what he was doing. And then one day a locomotive train appeared on his driveway. It had taken something in the region of five years, and he had scratch-built it in his garage. For the remaining years we lived there, he toured the nearby counties - towing children on railway tracks for fun.

I looked him up last year on the internet, and discovered he was still alive and well, and the president of an esteemed fellowship of master engineers in Oxford - he had only stood down a year or two previously. I read the article, and wished I had known him better - wished I had taken the time to get to know him. I bet he had amazing stories to tell.

            <Text>One morning while wandering through the streets of Witney on my way to the office, something in my head told me to stop off at the newsagent in Corn Street.

There were two news agents within easy walking distance of the bus stops – a big chain newsagent at the entrance to the shopping arcade that didn’t open until everybody had gone to work (I never did figure the logic behind that out), and a privately run one just round the corner.

As far as I could tell, the big difference between the two was everything except newspapers and chocolate bars. If you wanted to buy deodorant, toothpaste, stationary, both newsagents had them, but the big one had name brands. The other one had bootlegs of the same stuff. One morning in a bit of a panic I bought their cheap deodorant, and regretted it – it smelled of petrol, and burned the skin clean off your body.

The newsagent was run by a late thirties everyman called Gary. He had black hair, always look halfway smart, and seemed to always be on the receiving end of sarcasm from his “shop girl”. He wasn’t her Dad, but their working relationship certainly boredered on father daughter.

I never did find out her name. She was lovely. Probably only 18, and no doubt wiser in the ways of the world than me. She had brown bobbed hair, twinkling green eyes and a pinnafore that concealed any clue to the rest of her charms. I decided she was probably a good reason to buy a newspaper on a morning.

Of course the only problem with having an alterior motive for going in the newspaper shop on account of the girl behind the counter is that you suddenly become paranoid about your purchases. Do you really want to be seen buying “Personal Computer World” ?

I figured computer magazines were probably one up from porno mags, so bought them anyway – along with the hangover from my student days; FHM and Loaded.

Loaded was an out and out “lad mag” – filled with articles about the latest Z-list celeb, photoshoots with various young strumpets known only to the television adoring section of society, and news stories of drunken exploits, parties, and jokes you couldn’t tell your parents. FHM on the other hand had photoshoots of B-list celebs – the cast of baywatch and such like. Buying FHM was somehow more acceptible than Loaded.

In base terms, Loaded was to Hustler as FHM was to Playboy.

On this particular morning, I picked up a copy of The Independent, and plonked it down on the counter.

This was without doubt a “Watermelon moment”.

Any girl in the universe knows what I am talking about. For the rest of humanity, an explanation – in the 1980s movie “Dirty Dancing”, the character “Baby” played by Jennifer Grey is a young strumpet seeking the attentions of the focus of her infatuation – a dancer played by Patrick Swayze. Swayze’s main purpose throughout the movie seems to be (a) to take his top off as much as possibe, and (b) to gyrate against women while dancing.

Thrown into a scene where Baby enters the underground dance world inhabited in an impossibly unlikely manner by Swayze, her excuse for being there is “I carried a watermelon”.

These two basic ideas (no shirt, and crotch rubbing dance routine) seem to have created a mythology that has entered the gene pool. I’m sure girls are born these days with the phrase “I carried a watermelon” etched into their psyche.

If Captain Kirk had displayed a similar gratory dance routine while fighting aliens with his shirt off, the world could have ended up a very different place. Perhaps we won’t think about that for too long.

Where were we? Ah yes. Stood in front of shop girl.

“One pound please”

“Here you go”

Berk. Of all the impressive introductions I could have made, I chose “Here you go”.

While wandering up Church Green towards work, I played the scene through in my head. Arriving at the newspaper shop leaning from the top of a limmo like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman. Whoever bought a newspaper while leaning from the roof of a limmo?

Idiot.

A lady passed in the opposite direction towing some poor unfortunate rat of a dog on a lead. It was one of those little white fluffy dogs about the same size as a handbag, with a leg on each corner.

It occurred to me that if I took a run up and caught it just right, I could probably kick it quite a long way – get some real height on it.

Past the church, and out across the Leas, I started thinking about database stuff. The world of my newspaper shop muse was swapped for referential integrity and cascading updates.

I opened the office door and wandered through to my desk. It was 8:30, and not many people were in yet. After hanging my coat on the back of the chair and switching the computer on, I wandered off to wash my coffee mug up.

And there she was.

Sitting in the end office – the glass walled half conservatory – was the prettiest young blonde girl I had ever seen. Steve was sitting opposite, leaning back in his usual head cradling pose, talking and smiling.

Who was she? Was she new?

While making my coffee I peeked around the corner of the kitchen door, pretending to look around the office. Over Steve’s shoulder she looked at me.

Oh shit.

Then a cunning plan formed in my head. I’ll offer them a drink.

“Good morning! – can I get you two a hot drink?”

“We’ve already got one thanks Jon”

I closed the door and walked back down the office with my coffee, pretending to whistle, and pretending to be cool. As cool as you can be when you didn’t have a shave that morning, and your hair is sticking up a bit on one side. I nearly sat down at the wrong desk, but she wouldn’t have known that.

Over the next few minutes David and Graham arrived. As might be predicted, the new attraction was not missed by them either.

“Who’s that John?”

“Don’t know – they have been in there ever since I arrived”

“Marks out of two?”

“I’ll give her one!” said David in the manner a seven year old might while recounting the best joke ever that he had just heard in the playground.

Graham lifted one eyebrow in James Bond fashion and made an excuse to walk up the office. So did David.

I heard “Hot drink Steve?” in the distance, and smiled.

A little later – while retreating from the underneath of my desk arse first, I got to meet the mystery girl.

Straightening up, with a pen between my teeth, and tucking my shirt in, I said a muffled “Hello!” and shook her hand.

Sonia was apparently introducing her to everybody.

“This is Hailey. She’s starting today, and will be helping me with paperwork, filing, typing…”

“And making us lovely coffees!”

I smiled, and mouthed “take no notice” to her. She was probably only 17, and straight out of school. Now she was stood in front of me, there was nothing of her at all, but by crikey was she ever pretty.

I’m not quite sure how some girls do it, but her expertly messy short hair looked like a still had been taken of a movie on a windy day, and was now walking around on top of her head. She had huge blue eyes, and a huge colgate smile.

Later in the day I nearly caused Sonia to wet herself.

While sorting out a computer for Hailey, she was leaning out of my way, and slid half off her office chair. If anybody had walked in at that moment, they would have wondered what on earth was going on. Thankfully the company wasn’t big enough to have an HR person.

Hailey’s legs were stuck between the chair and the desk, while she approximated a limbo act, leaning on the floor and in fits of giggles…

“I can’t get up!”

I stood up from my own precarious stretch to plug in a monitor cable, and took her by her wrist. Not having much experience of lifting model type girls from the floor, or having much clue about elegance and grace, I just lifted her back on the chair.

Setting her back down, Sonia exploded in giggles, spitting her cup of tea across her keyboard.

“What?”

“Oh Jon”

“What?”

Hailey was killing herself laughing now too.

“You just lifted her up like a rag doll!”

“She doesn’t weigh much”

“That’s not the point! Oh.. I’m going to wee myself”

Graham had seen it too, and was grinning.

I had no idea why they all though my lifting her back on her chair was so funny. I guess I had lifted her bodily into the air by her wrist, but I was kind of busy at the time. What was I supposed to have done? Swept her up in my arms?

I might know much, but I knew Hailey was embarassed now – judging from her beetroot cheeks.

“Are you okay?”

“Yes, fine”, she said, wiping a tear from her eye, still giggling.

I switched her computer on, and it started spurting text up onto the screen.

“Do you understand all this stuff then?”

“Yep”

“Blimey. It’s all gobbledegook to me”

“Me too, but don’t tell anybody”

“Really?”

It would be uncharitable to say that Hailey was stupid, because she certainly wasn’t. She did reinforce many of the sterotypes about blondes though.

After getting her logged into Windows, and showing her how to write letters, save them and print them out, I wandered back to my desk.

I overheard Sonia asking Halley if she knew the key to print in Wordstar a few minutes later.

While munching on my lunch a little later in the day, it struck me that I knew Hailey better than David or Graham now - a certain smugness came over me. I also started worrying for her – she hadn’t met Mr Lines yet. He was at a doctors appointment and wouldn’t be in until after lunch.

No he wasn’t. I could hear him. He’d met her.

“Wehey! Hey! Look at this Sonia! They’ve got me an assistant! You’re sat at the wrong desk young lady – here’s where you can sit - Angela – you’re moving desks to up here.”

“No I’m bloody not!”

“It’s alright young Hailey – you let Mr Lines look after you”

Hailey didn’t know what to say or do, and Sonia – despite her better judgement – looked like she might wet herself again.

“Leave her alone David!”

Suddenly Mr Lines became the father of daughters I didn’t know he had, and my perception of him changed.

“It’s lovely to meet you Hailey. My name is David Lines. You do as my mate Sonia says, and you won’t go far wrong.”

There was suddenly a warmth. The letcherous old git had turned into a favourite uncle at the flick of a switch. Here was the Mr Lines I would grow to like, and never forget.
