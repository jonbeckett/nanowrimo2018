<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Past attempts at NaNoWriMo, blogging history, description of my family life, and writing environment - how and when I will write, where I will save it, etc.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>First Computer</strong><br/>The first time I ever saw a computer was in the spare room at my grandparents house. It looked like something from a 1970s science fiction movie, and was threatening to destroy the table it was precariously perched upon - such was it's girth. It had been purchased to use for book-keeping at the family business, and was being prepared with accounts software. Of course I didn't know this at the time - I was only seven or eight years old - all I knew was that it looked awesome, and that I was not a...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>MSX</strong><br/>Memories of the first computer I ever used in anger - the MSX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Electric Organs</strong><br/>During the late 1980s, my parents became interested in music keyboards. How they became interested in them is perhaps one of the most unlikely stories you're likely to hear.<br/>
<br/>
You see - throughout the late 1980s my brother competed in schoolboy motocross. This mostly entailed getting up early on a Sunday morning, and standing in the rain throughout the day, watching him ride round a muddy track in circles until we went home again. There was of course more to it than that, but to my twelve year ol...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Atari ST</strong><br/>Anything and everything I can remember about the Atari ST.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>486</strong><br/>One day, late in the autumn of 1989, my Dad floated the idea with me of selling the Atari ST, and buying a PC to replace it. We hadn’t been using the Atari for it’s original purpose - music production - for years, and it was obvious from the various magazines we occasionally bought where the future was headed. The Atari ST, and it’s long-time rival, the Commodore Amiga, were fast becoming obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
The weeks that followed saw us purchase magazine after magazine - learning an entirely new lexico...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Internet</strong><br/>Memories of how the internet made it's way into my life - Compuserve, Cix, AOL, etc. Bulletin Boards, dial-up modems. The Compuserve Writer's Forum. Remembering Google appearing. Meeting W via the net.</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Arriving at my First Job</strong><br/>Memories of working at ABS. The job, the characters, the nights out, the christmas parties. Lots of stories. The fact that I still miss it, 20 years later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Working at ABS</strong><br/>My arrival at my new employer could be described best as accidentally falling from a moving car, and landing completely unscathed, on your feet.<br/>
<br/>
A few short days ago I had been watching the world go by from the window of a portacabin in a hell hole. I now had my own desk, my own computer, my own chair, my own stapler, my own pens, pencils, ruler, pen holder - you name it.<br/>
<br/>
While admiring all my new toys, I remember the middle-aged man sitting directly in front of me spinning around in his offic...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Thought Cafe</strong><br/>Back in the early days of the internet, if you signed up for a service such as Compuserve, or America Online, not only would you be charged a monthly membership fee, you would also pay for the cost of the phone call to connect to their service. Over time those costs were folded into the membership fees, but it was still limiting - the world wide web appeared, and they acted as gatekeepers.<br/>
<br/>
The solution to all of this was the “Internet Service Provider” - rather than connect to a walled garden s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>RAF Brize Norton</strong><br/>I grew up in Carterton - a small town in the Cotswolds, a few miles from Oxford. Carterton had been founded by a farmer called Carter a couple of hundred years before, and had grown over time. It was an “in-between” place. Witney, famous for wool and blankets was a little way away, and the various Wychwood villages - the inspiration for “The Shire” in Tolkien’s books - a few miles in the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
When you tell somebody you’re from Carterton, they stare at you blankly. Then you tell them...</p>
